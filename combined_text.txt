__label__Workers-Comp ​NCCI Inspection Report
__label__Not-LOB-Specific ​Good morning Kim/Karen, I was hoping to get some assistance from FRC in communicating the below to the field.  Billing is attempting to address an ongoing issue where pay plans are being changed (either from Direct to Agency or vice versa) via mid-term endorsement or cancel/rewrite transactions.  This is causing downstream impacts for the agents, insureds and CNA since often times the bills are already paid when this happens. A workflow change is being implemented for both the endorsement and issuance processing groups for all business units, where approval from billing must first be obtained before these requests can be processed (see attached).    The purpose being to allow billing time to reach out to the UW, Agent or  Insured to explain the potential impacts.  It sounds like more often than not, they are successful in convincing the customer to hold off on the change until policy renewal, thus avoiding any issues. Ideally, it would make sense for the field to reach out to the billing group for approval prior to submitting the requests to processing, using mailboxciagencybill@cna.com . Please let me know if FRC would be able to assist or if you have any questions and we can discuss further. Thank you,

__label__Auto Good morning,  I am hoping you may be able to advise if there is potential for changes to EPC Auto, or make note of these recommendation.  After meeting with several of my UTs yesterday as they have started to work on August renewals the following concerns were brought up. Unable to change class codes between private passenger and commercial vehicles without deleting and adding the vehicle.  The UTs were especially concerned about this as we will have new business requests where the agent may not have provided that level of detailed information while we are initially rating the policy.  Thus there is a lot of duplicated efforts to correct vehicles that need to have their class codes changed. For bulk rating, when no cost new is entered for a vehicle the system is notify the UT one by one that these vehicles have no cost new versus all at once, which is what occurred in TAP.  The UT has to get out of bulk rating and go into each vehicle.  Can this be changed?

__label__Auto Hello Everyone,We had processed the ca/rw as originally requested, we were unaware that this new form needed to be added. We can have the form added however the form is not available on the policy to be added. We will need to have someone upload the form to the policy so that Teresa is able to have it added.There used to be a workflow in speaking with Rafael that UW/UT would have to follow when creating forms to have them added. I don't know of this workflow so I am attaching the FRC to the email to see if they can provide any guidance to have this uploaded to our share drive? Or wherever it needs to be uploaded too so we are able to have this new form added to the policy.Also I believe new forms had to be approved through legal first as well which I see below in the email, but I am not sure who needs to upload this as we don't have the capability to do from our end. Once it is uploaded we can process the change.Please advise when this is completed.Thank you,

__label__Workers-Comp Please review the attached endorsement for the 2016/2017 policy term returned to us by the agent.  Per their email below, they are having a hard time figuring out what or why this endorsement was processed!  I cannot find any documentation anywhere stating what was done.  This endorsement, as well as the audit, were both processed on 01/26/18. From what I could make out, a class code was added in CO on an if any basis.  The bulk of the premium charge is coming from OK – deductible credit not subject to exp rating.  This amount ($370) looks like it was on the renewal policy as a negative amount, but when this endorsement was processed, they system is now charging the $370 minus premium discount.  None of this makes any sense.  The agent actually explains this below in their email also. Please help!  We need to be able to give the agent aclear explanation of what is being done on this transaction.  Your assistance will be greatly appreciated!  Thanks

__label__Package-General-Liability Middlefield Oak's PLGL was supposed to be a flat renewal. If I compare the expiring requote to the renewal quote, both show exposures of 85 AL and 176 MC. However, the rate monitor is showing a 40% reduction in rate. We found out that there were premium overrides last year, but do not think this would affect the rate. Can you track down why we would be showing a 40% decrease on an account where no exposures changed? The other lines are OK.

__label__Workers-Comp ​thank you for bringing this to my attention.  I don't know why those Named Insureds were deleted… The only endorsement request I have from you about Named Insureds is this one (attached) and you're asking us to add, not delete.  Apologize for not getting back to you earlier, for some reason this email went to my Junk mail. I'll get back to you with an explanation asap. 
__label__Auto ​I updated the BUA quote to include an additional common coverage.  I waited before refreshing RST and the revised premium isn't pulling into the dashboard.  The auto premium should be $19,591 due to the addition of the coverage but it remains at $19,427.  If this premium doesn't update then my CUE premium is incorrect.  Any suggestions?

__label__Package-Property ​FRC copied on email:Hi Jackie and Ann,I apologize for missing this email on Thursday. Unfortunately, there is no easy answer here.Rapid is not set up to output Canada exposures. That's been on the upgrade wish list for some time, but it has never been a high enough priority given other work.So, your question about getting this modeled is a very good one. There are definitely a few other LP accounts in this situation, and I frankly don't know how these are incorporated into the rating process. I assume that UWs use the standard non-modeled rates embedded in the LP rater. For any details on that, I recommend going to folks on the pricing team. In very special circumstances, we can input data manually and produce model results.For the account in question, I only see one location with any noteworthy EQ risk. The Vancouver location has EQ risk comparable to Seattle and other parts of the Pacific Northwest. Still, the values here are not very large ($1.2M), so it's not going to generate much AAL—in other words, this doesn't look like it's worth the effort of a manual modeling.I hope that helps. If you have more questions about what to do in these situations, I recommend going to the property AVP group to raise this question. If it makes sense, they can start up the process of setting up a more official playbook for these situations. 
__label__Package-General-Liability Hi All,Would you be able to assist with the following question:Why we need this for an admitted placement? 
__label__Auto Hi,I wrote a new account for February. The broker advised they had issues with the previous carrier on handling vehicle changes in NY. Below is what they informed me.This account has 15 PPTS (high end leases) and these leases are frequently traded in for newer models. Apparently if the previous carrier simply deleted the vehicle and added the new vehicle the DMV would send notice of suspension. The broker said NY DMV needs the vehicle to be filed as a replacement vehicle so that they know the tags are being transferred and are not being turned in.I would assume we have had to come across this situation in the past and how did we handle it.Thanks,

__label__Workers-Comp ​FRC Team – the agent is requesting further explanation on how the RP was calculated on the attached NY endorsement and an AP was calculated on the MA endorsement. For the NY endorsement, the just added a location with no payroll, and an RP was calculated. For the MA endorsement, the NCCI Mod for 9/1/18 – 2/1/19 split period was amended from 1.00 to .99, but an AP was calculated. Further explanation on where the RP and APs are coming from would be helpful for both the insured and agent (and this underwriter). 
__label__Workers-Comp ​Good afternoon, I would like to have some help on this question: Thank you – we have never received this endorsement to account for the rest of the $9 we were off when checking the audit. This $9 credit on this endorsement does make sense for the final paid at audit, HOWEVER, I need an explanation on what this endorsement is actually doing. If the experience modifier went from 0.88 (eff 4/8/17) to 1.26 (eff 9/1/17), why is there a $2 credit shown on this line (see page 14 of the endorsement)? Also on this same page, it shows payroll changed for 4/8/17-9/1/17 and again 9/1/17-4/8/18…would assume it wouldn't be a credit, however with an experience mod increase so great. I understand why the payroll is split with those dates, but I'm really confused as to why it's a credit? The accounting portion now lines up perfectly with the receipt of this endorsement but the endorsement itself is confusing to me. I just need an explanation in order to process appropriately.  CNA sent a response the following response: Please refer to the W.C endorsement – page 14 of 28 – there is a $9 return in premium.Their W.C Emod:09-01-2016 is 0.8809-01-2017 is 1.2604-08-2018 is 1.26 We quoted the W.C on 03/30/2017 with Tentative Emod of 0.88. After we issued the policy, we received a notice from NCCI stating Emod was updated. Please see the 2nd attached email. I sent an email to Jane Orr on 05/31/2017 regarding the Emod changed to 1.26.The 3rd email was the endorsement sent on 06/05/2018 regarding the updated Emod of 1.26. Agent come back with the following: Thanks, Kevin. I understand all that you said below. I know you guys have to issue carrier endorsements due to things like e-mod changes mid-term, rate changes, etc. I see that a lot on all my accounts. My question was that there is a $9 return premium when the e-mod increased significantly from estimated 4/8 to actual on 9/1. So how is there a return?? That's what I don't understand. It should have been Subject to audit and all picked up at audit. What was taken away to get a $9 return credit?  It's such a weird amount to me that I just have to be able to explain it to the client. And That's what doesn't make sense to me. Was all the additional premium picked up at final audit? I was seeking help with different departments; here are my response so far:Endorsement team - I received your request inquiring about the attached transaction.  The transaction was processed by premium audit.   Premium Audit Manager - Please look into the billing.  It doesn't appear they are disputing the actual audit exposures, so I am forwarding this to you.Billing - I do not know why processing say this is a billing/collection  issue since the endorsement  they process generated credit Endorsement was process on 05/11/18. In collections we are not trained in reading what the endorsements are doing. This is a processing /underwriting issue, I have attached the endorsement for you. At this point, I don't know where I should go for clarification, Thank you for your help,

__label__Umbrella ​Hi Kris,When I was attaching the BOR completed email and Renewal Information needed email to the Renewal Term it went to the 2nd CUE down with the same effective date of 03/01/2018.  How do I combine them or at least get DMF to attach to the policy I want? 
__label__Workers-Comp ​Hi Team! Do we have any resources available (possibly a communication) to direct agents to the CNAC Help Desk or otherwise if we notice that we are getting a significant number of agent requests to forward policy output?  Tracy's note below seems to point to an issue specific to CUE & WC.  I knew about the CUE issue; however, I am looking for something we can attach to our responses for policy/endorsement output which gently points our agents in the right direction.  The frequency seems to be greater than a one-off situation.  Thanks!
__label__Package-Property ​Good morning, We have a PMT policy (6072055841) which is going to be composite rated.  The original GL premium was $82,301, then we converted to composite and rerated with same base rates and modifiers.  The premium came out to $71,161.  The final rates were different and the same base rates and modifiers were used.  Please advise on this situation.  This is a piece of new business that needs to be issued. Thank you,

__label__Umbrella ​The issue is, among others with Hasse, that USI pro-rated the annual Umbrella that was quoted at $53,653. Hasse changed the policy period to 8/1/2017 to 3/1/2018. USI pro-rated the annual and told them it would be $31,172. The weird thing is that we issued it at $42,625. Don't know where that came from. Anyway, USI has asked for a complete accounting on all transactions from 8/1/2017 to the present ( they are late on their current payment, stating they mailed it) and USI wants us to change the Umbrella to $31,172. I'm just the messager, as this issue has gone on for way too long. I'm certain we can get an accounting, but I was hoping someone could look into what happened on the Umbrella. USI should have asked us for a revised proposal after the policy periods had been changed. That would have worked better than their pro rating the Umbrella all of the premiums themselves. I'm not certain any of the premiums are correct. If you could have someone contact billing to get a detailed report of the transactions and then find out what did happen on the Umbrella, I'd appreciate it.

__label__Umbrella ​Good Afternoon:I received a submission from one of our key agents to write a monoline umbrella policy this afternoon.  It is a bit tricky. Here are the details: Our Middle Market Dept received a submission, all lines including umbrella back in December, but it was declined, I will call this agent #1.Reason for the decline was lack of time, information, and from an agent we do little business with and is a challenging class of business. A few months later, our MM department received this same submission, complete w/ all information, from our KEY agent, I will call agent #2, and our MM department needed to decline, since we had already declined it 3 months prior for 'agent #1'. This is not what our MM dept wanted to do, but under the circumstances, they had to decline as well since it had been prior and declined. Today, I received a phone call from agent #2 and asked if I would write the monoline umbrella. It would be my understanding and opinion that I can quote this new business monoline umbrella policy because 'agent #1' submitted the entire account and never considered sending in for monoline umbrella handling. Since this was sent in for monoline umbrella ONLY, from agent #2, and never declined for monoline umbrella only to agent #1, I would be in a position to quote. Lastly, agent #2 now controls this account and did forward to me a BOR, just in case that was needed.  They have placed the MM coverages, WC, AL, GL, Prop, with another  carrier and need C NA for umbrella. I am sorry for the RUSH, but they are looking for this quote ASAP. If you would like to call and discuss, please contact me at the number below on this email. Thanking you in advance for your immediate attention in this matter.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Another CA Waiver mess that included Small Business, WWO and the agent.  It appears that the reason for a premium charge was an error was made on the processing of a waiver (payrolls were not reduced) and the policy was subsequently cancelled.  This resulted in the agent expecting the policy revision and a reduction or refund of the monies owing.  Final Audit was pending so this did not occur.
__label__Package-Property PMT 4034209262See agent's email below.  This is a 12/31/17 effective date policy and the contractors blanket AI form printed with version 01/15.  Product catalog for this form states that the 10/16 version should have been used on policies effective 5/15/17 and later.  This should have generated the new version and not the old one.  Even if it went by written date, the written date is 9/30/17 which is after 5/15/17.
__label__Auto ​The 9/15/18-19 renewal was written with the Brock Ins Agency by BOR. In the past we were able to transfer the MVR's from the prior policy number to the new auto number. However, in this case, it appears that when the new auto number BUA 6072758484  was set up in EPC as an BOR, EPC also initiated the MVR Account but did not transfer the MVR's from the old policy number BUA 6043350757 to the new number BUA 6072758484. This has enable me to go into the MVR System under the old number 6043350757 and access the updated account information to reassign the MVR's to the new policy number and producer code. I am receiving the following error message: Cannot Have Duplicate Lists for a Policy Quote Number. DriverList (with ID 215757 ) already exists for Policy Quote# 6072758484 At this point, it does not make sense for me to re-order the MVR's on the drivers so they can appear under the new number due to the cost involved. However, I would like to know if there is a way to transfer the driver information from one policy number to another under the same account once a number is set up in EPC and EPC initiates the MVR Account?

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Andrew, last year the annual revenues  were 17,986,566. The policy is an odd  term , short 5/6/17-5/1/18. The premium was pro rated but not the exposure  in tap. The premium  may have been overridden/entered. How will Merlin calc the rate this year? If we put the actual premium paid ( pro rate term of 18,445) into the  rate tap it  develops a 36%- rate. If I put the annual premium in, it is flat. Let me know what I can expect. I think the rater should be entered with the  2017 annual, if so indication is flat based on same pricing structure which is probably correct.This is a 25k annual premium ( short term was 18,445) renewing to 31k so its worth checking.

__label__Auto  Description:I am not sure where the significant increase is coming from on the auto. Number of employees decreased, and cost of hire is in line with previous years. The only difference I see is the driving payroll exposure. Something is off here, as the driving payroll exposure last year totaled to $2,993,918 and this year the total payroll is $19,848,245. I did go back and look at the renewal updates sent in from last year and the payroll for the class codes taken into account here was around ~$22M, so not even close to the ~$3M used. I am assuming this is a system issue, so any assistance you can provide to get the auto inline would be very helpful!

__label__Package-General-Liability For CPM policy # 6014740478 / Acct # 0120126857, we have a problem with issuance.In 2017 we moved their effective/expiration date from 4/1 to 7/1, using a short term policy as a bridge.At the expiration of 4/1/16-4/1/17 policy term, I proposed a short term policy for 4/1/17 – 7/1/17.This policy was issued per the proposal on 4/19/17.The error is that on 4/20/17, the same rates and exposure as the short term policy were also issued for an annual policy with the term of 7/1/17 – 7/1/18.We then worked the annual renewal in June, with updated exposures and modified rates and issued a policy per that proposal for the term of 7/1/17 – 7/1/18 on 7/11/17.I've attached a couple of e-mails on this one.  The first is an e-mail in May where we noticed and communicated the problem with the policy issued on 4/20/17 – this policy was never cancelled.The second is when we were running into technical rating errors when working the renewal for the July issuance.It appears that we may have never billed the policy issued on 4/20 – but we should verify what we have billed.  The agent is meeting with the insured to work through their invoices.A problem at this time is the insured pulled the policy issued on 4/20 when meeting with the agent for this renewal and that is their expectation on what we issued.At this point, we may need to keep the policy that is issued on 4/20 in force and adjust exposures at audit and cancel the policy issued on 7/11 that was the intended renewal.

Please be sure to specify the effective date for the endorsements which should be inception or the date the name was added.All Workers Compensation files electronically for all carriers through WCPOLS by issuance of the policy or endorsement. There is no manual filing as NCCI and the states will only accept the electronic filing which is produced by issuance of the policy or endorsement.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Team, While sitting out on the production floor today this issue came up and I thought you may be able to help us find the information we need.  The form we were discussing is WC 36.  It is State specific to Hawaii and the policy we were working with needs the form since they have an employee so even though CAN does not really write coverage in Hawaii we need to cover this particular employee.  And the State of Hawaii requires that form.  We have looked everyplace we can think of and cannot find the form in Resource Library.  There are instructions how to complete it but not a blank form. It would be great if you could point us in the direction of this form so it can be filled out. Thanks,
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Hello - Reaching out on all lines of business on this account.  The rate should show as flat in RST.  This is coming off short term policies so it's not accurately reflected in RST.  GL was also converted to PGL and since our law firm rates are still very high we had to add additional credits to get the rate to flat.  Please reach out to me with any questions., 
__label__Monoline Good Day!I have researched this but still can't figure out why AP was charged per the attached endorsement.

__label__Workers-Comp ​1/5/18 Email from Requestor to WWO:Thanks Rafael.  The waiver doesn't need to be on for the quote, they do not print, the charge just needs to be correct.  As far as I can the number of waivers is correct, just one of the entities falls off when the 1st waiver becomes non-editable.   At issue, it would need to be added back on.  Sending back for a requote is not really a good use of time to add back on a waiver.  It is time consuming setting up requotes and then following up on them.  I have been putting the information of waiver to add back on in my issue instructions.   But this also requires time to look at expiring policy to determine what waiver fell off.  There is a an underwriting issue that generates but I don't know how the PSR interprets it.  It does not state the entity.    Why couldn't this be cleaned up as part of the renewal process.  Thanks (FRC copied)Rafael - I haven't heard anything back on this.  Last time we talked you were setting up a meeting with someone to go over the workflow (I think that's what you said), and at that point you did not think I should be on the call.  ThanksSue's request to WWO/EPC:Amy – please bear with me but I did review the job aid and I'm still confused.  I understand what you are saying here: When we went live with EPC the system would not allow you to ever delete the first waiver of subrogation that was added to the policy. If you got a request to do so you would have to delete the entire coverage and then go back and endorse on all of the waivers again. This wasn't acceptable so we put in a change request to EPC which now allows any name to be deleted as per the request of the underwriter or agent.  When this system change went in the names need to be added back on the additional forms capture at time of renewal. Please look at policy wc4026958764.  Just the placeholder waiver form is on but the actual waiver with entity information has fallen off – who adds this back on and when.  In this case it's easy to see that a waiver needs to be added but what about policies that have a lot of waivers.  This really affects be so I want to make sure I understand.

If we do not include comprehensive/collision coverage for Hired Auto but do have a BA PLUS endorsement for the state of VA, physical damage would still be denied, correct? I know in our auto form coverage is states, If you carry Comprehensive Coverage for the damaged covered auto, we will pay for the following under Comprehensive Coverage:          a.  Glass breakage;          b.  Loss caused by hitting a bird or animal; and          c.  Loss caused by falling objects or missiles. The BA plus for VA was added to the Other Coverages and does have physical damage language as follows: C. Physical DamageSECTION III – PHYSICAL DAMAGE COVERAGE is amended as follows:1. Glass Breakage – Hitting A Bird Or Animal – Falling Objects Or MissilesThe following paragraph is added to A.3., Glass Breakage:With respect to private passenger autos only, any deductible shown in the Declarations will not applyto glass breakage if such glass is repaired, in a manner acceptable to us, rather than replaced.  I understand this language to only amend intent for the deductible applied but does not grant physical damage.  Thank you,
__label__Workers-Comp ​Hi folks: The attached bill was received by a CNA customer.   The customer wanted to pay the bill, and called the phone number on the bill:   877.276.7507.    When you press 1, to pay the bill, you'll get silence.  Our FSS and I tried the number and got the same empty line result. Also, as I look at this invoice, my feedback would be that it's not clear on why we are charging the $92.   What's the endorsement?? Thank you!
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Can you find out how the UT will handle Technology Fast Track accounts when there is Tech E&O, Media and Information Risk coverage?  RST does not have a flag for GL ELP rated policies …will that apply to Tech coverage as well?

__label__Workers-Comp ​Thanks again for the call.  I spoke to Kevin and we do want to find out why EPC for TX WC shows company deviation of 2 vs. 1.60.  I did reach out to a TX UW who confirmed that some company deviations were just updated in July.I went and pulled those state profiles just in case what I had saved in my briefcase didn't update…..for TX, CC is still showing a 1.60 on the spreadsheet.Let me know what else your team will need and what they find out.   Thanks!
__label__Not-LOB-Specific ​Hi Everyone, Jamie Ewing helped us with my last person who joined my team.  We need Wendy Whetzel  (caa2216) to be changed from PSR to Underwriting technician with Underwritng authority,  you can mirror her access to Tamara Okuwa who was the most recent transfer from WWO to UT.  Need to add the Underwriting & Aging Services Southern Traditional Underwriting Technicians groups. Role needs to be changed to UT and Authority from PSR to UT. 
__label__Workers-Comp ​We continue to run into this obstacle of getting WC policies issued because WWO is wanting a physical addresses for states that are on an If any basis.  These are generally instances where we have a contractor based in Texas who may perform work outside of the state and want to know what the rates are in states they may bid work on.  They will never have an office location there other than jobsite address if they eventually perform work there.  This wasn't an issue prior to EPC and agents say other carriers do not need this information.  If is becoming a source of frustration for them.  The contractors want to know the rates in the states they might possibly bid work in or if they have a contract with a company with locations in multiple states. Can we see if there is any flexibility here if a state has no payroll listed for it.  We are having to drop some of the states off our policy to issue sometimes and that frustrates the agents.
__label__Workers-Comp ​Do we have any regulations for posting notices going to telecommuters?

__label__Auto I pulled the rating worksheets to help illustrate my point . The insured had a large experience rating credit applied . In addition last year the insured moved the garaging address of their entire fleet which was causing  an additional premium of around 28K so we waited to  change at renewal because I did not want to give this much credit back due to potential severity .  I did change the Irpm debit from 1.30 to 1.19 and the experience credit did increase however I changed the garage address to the entire fleet  which caused an increase in per veh premium.  My rate did not go down in fact it increased and now a report was generated showing a very large decrease . After discussion with Greg I would like to see if this is something you could look into.

__label__Workers-Comp Good morning!  Can you please assist with the following information?  Thank you! 1.    MISSOURI COMPLIANCE (MO location with payroll): For any policy with MO exposure/payroll, we are required to verify that MO compliance guidelines have been met before we are allowed to issue. There is no mention of MO compliance in UWS or DMF. Please provide updated proof of MO compliance being met. I have included the job aid link below, showing that we are not allowed to proceed with issuance until this information has been confirmed.https://refdocs.cna.com/WorkplaceXT/getContent?objectStoreName=kbos&id=release&objectType=document&vsId={101A2557-0900-C2A4-8008-E878C393C3C6}  2.    NOTE:Please be advised that at least one of the states on the policy requiring a specific location address when applicable, is currently listed as non-specific. We will issue the policy using the no specific location verbiage per EPC; if/when any applicable location addresses are provided, the policy can be updated via endorsement accordingly. The non-specific states currently requiring a location address if one applies are:AL, ME, NE, NH, NV, RI & SC. (Please note that employee's home addresses are not considered valid location addresses and would instead use the NSL verbiage.) 3.    PREMIUM DIFFERENCE:Please be advised that the NCCI EMOD is 1.03 effective 11/1/17, and .95 effective 11/1/18.  After updating the policy with the split mod in accordance with the NCCI bureau, the new premium per EPC is $224,457 in lieu of $224,541 on the binding instructions. Please advise  if okay to proceed with issuance.

__label__Package-Property ​Good Morning, I have a question regarding crime pricing.  We quoted $250k of crime on this account with a $2,500 deductible both last year and this year for this PMT policy (6012448803). Last year the coverage charge was $1,241.This year, for the same limits / structure , the charge is $2,068. My question is,Did we have a rate change on crime coverage from last year to this year (this is in MA)Does changing the credit structure on the property (IRPM) directly correlate to 'stand-alone' crime coverage as they are written on the same policy form? Appreciate your help!

__label__Package-General-Liability ​I'm hoping you can help me. We recently had an issue where we had a CRN request sent and the way we had laid out the notice was not followed when the notice was actually sent. When the notice was sent, there was a large amount of confusion around what the real intent of the notice was. This confusion would have been cleared up had the notice been sent out with the formatting provided in the request. I understand the formatting might not be available, however if that was the case, why did the processor not request clarification? If we would have been advised that they were unable to format the notice as requested, we may have been able to come up with a different solution. Please advise so we know how to proceed in the future. In the past we have been told that the comments section could be copied and pasted into the notice. Thank you for your help.

The account was not taken over via AOR and that is how it is being treated. I am curious to know if the agent that was on Utilitex still has access to their past information or if that was transferred to Willis as well. Based on ours being transferred, that once should have been too.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Hi Karen, Hoping you can help point me in the right direction on who can help generate a special report that identifies policies with ELP rating. My sense is that RST has reporting capabilities that we can leverage to identify policies that contain ELP Rates. My overarching goal is to be able to cross reference an RST report of ELP Rated polices with a DMF report of policies that contain an ELP tool to be able to show which policies are missing the ELP Tool. I am good on the DMF portion of my plan but I need help with the RST ELP side of things. I am copying Scott on this because he asked to be looped in to better understand what reporting capabilities you might be able to tap into to support this initiative. Best,JSP

If it is not, however, we were told that CNA is filed to give up to 15% schedule credit or debit in certain states.  Normally, if it says it is not eligible for schedule modification, you would do a Legal Statement saying it was not eligible for schedule modification.  In the case where the 15% is used, the system says not eligible but we show we applied a factor.Do we document this as a normal sched mod even though the system indicates it is not eligible or do we use the legal statement since it says it is not eligible and then a documentation form for the credit? Or do we not have to document the credit in this scenario since it is a CNA filed exception?

__label__Package-Property ​FRC, I'm reaching out to see if this warrants a note to the field. We received an inquiry from an underwriter who had a policy issued that was on reporting and needed to see if we had received the reports of value. In this case the MM PSR was not aware that it was on reporting and a task was never set up. I am working on getting some automation that will flag the PSR if it is on reporting, we had this in the past. In the interim we would need the UT/UW to note on the issue instructions if the PMT policy is on reporting so the PSR can have the follow-up task created.

__label__Umbrella ​Hello, After some research and confirmation from Ramona Bennett the Umbrella policy is set-up by NAS along with the other lines per their workflow.  With the new return w/out rating process should rating really be setting up CUE policies as some may have to be returned w/out rating if the GL or BUA policy is returned w/out rating.  We are trying to determine the best practice if NAS would miss setting up the CUE policy for the cross-sell initiative.  Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.  New Account Set-up (NAS) follows this process.  The only time they would not set-up an umbrella policy is when a monoline umbrella policy already exists on the account.https://intranet.cna.com/web/user/home/federatedsearch/!ut/p/z1/hY_dSsQwEIVfxX2AknS71O6FF-1Ci38UrK4mNzJbx1pMUpmkC769s62Cwi6GgczkO3M4EVo8Ce1g33cQ-sGB4Vnp9Dmr4o2sV_FtfbMtZX6VXZfrKk1kFoutePxPohnLEyeXvK-PSHJZ3C2LRMqqXh4V_PFQnOH8ZIZVKh7cQJb_0xy8_ECh-OSlqR-pRaHm2194at-i3gUChyHiKXrtDXI_iREY3yNZoVoavD_zaMxEYI8vzYRLA93sbcFBh9QECKOfnwONeEBsGpB-Qrzvml_O4sOW68tI2Sz5rnyx-AI3mMjb/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/ UMBRELLA Umbrella Cross-Sell For submissions that do not include a request or application for Umbrella, if a GL and BUA application is located, setup a CUE policy with the same effective dates as a cross sell opportunity.1.

__label__Auto Hi Mike, good morning.Hey, I'm sorry to bother you with this … but do you know this before I spend an hour researching it ?Per our conversation this insured has a symbol 6 for uninsured motorist, which is when uninsured  motorist is required in the state.  My understanding is California does not require uninsured motorist as coverage can be rejected.  So it would seem this should be a symbol 7 on the policy, since all of the policies are being charged for this coverage.  Will you please confirm if coverage is required or if the wrong symbol is on this policy.

__label__Umbrella ​Per the email below, please review and advise how the commission amount can be changed in EPC for this cancel-rewrite of the 2017 Term to extend the term?  See Frank Engle's email from 7/16/18.----------------------------------------------------------------From Frank Engle: Ania/Ayanna,Sorry for the delay in responding to this. I'm comfortable with what they are trying to do, but also have never seen a request like this.  I will support their request, however, my concern is HOW we would do this.  First, we'd want to make sure executing this is within compliance, but with other carriers doing it, perhaps that isn't a concern.Also, I'm not sure the system will allow it since it's technically a policy term that has already been issued.  Perhaps this question is best answered by the Field Resource Center?----------------------------------------------------------From agent: Do you have any flexibility here?  This is not an issue with any of the other carriers and it's looking more and more like there won't be a renewal on this.  The PE firm that owns ITG just acquired another similar type company and the writing on the wall leads us to believe that ITG will be rolling into their program.  We've been on a fee for this program, but ITG asked that we have the extensions include commission so they could forgo paying the fee.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Good Morning,Per the screen shot below, we are having a pricing issue with the captioned account. This was previously rated off of area, but with the transition to PGL it is now rated off of # of Lawyers. The issue at hand is that the premium is being jacked up with this new rating system to the point where we will lose the account. I had previously communicated to the broker that we would be renewing flat. A flat rate would result in a premium of approx. $17,250. With the new rating basis, the lowest possible premium that we can be is the $27,317 figure below. We were also just provided with renewal values and the # of lawyers that we are currently rating off of is actually less than the true figure -519, and therefore we can expect this to go up even more once that is rerated.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Good morning,I also left a VM this morning at a little past 7 AM CST.We have an ongoing issue since the 2017 audit was completed and issues in early March 2018. The audit was returned with incorrect construction rates versus what was quoted/bound.  The issues was reported to audit for Policy # 4025715568.  Audit tried to fix the issues and then reported it as an IT issue under INC0537752. Now Billing has become an issue because the incorrect audit rates have created a $10K AP bill which is past due where really there should be a small RP.   Please escalate both issues and try to resolve this as quick as possible. This is the second year in a row that audit/IT issues on this GL policy has caused a delay in our service to this customer and they are becoming irritated with the agent and CNA.  This will impact our ability to retain this account if not solved in a more timely manner.Respectfully,Tim Moynihan

As we know that system is not letting us update the year of update for electrical which doesn't even get printed on papers which are issued to customer. But due to internal use we need to have the update year for processing.   For internal information prospective we can have the approve text and EMS comments updated that team has used what year as update and get the policy processed. This will help in getting the pend reduced and will help in clearing these backlog with sopping follow-ups which we are seeing.

__label__Auto ​Good afternoon – Per our agreement with Marsh QSG we need to include the below forms.  Rana is indicating that with the new EPC system we cannot add these forms.  We need a workaround in order to include.Hi Adele, The system since changing over from TAP to EPC  is now restricting the use of those forms when we do not have vehicles.  The following was sent to me from the Field Resource Center:  NY Extended Coverage Endorsement – BA Plus – SCA23500B31UW / LOB intent was that the BA+ was not to be provided on HNOA only policies. In TAP there was no edit to prevent attachment. In EPC there is an edit that prevents attachment. Hired auto Specified as Covered Autos you Own  CA 9916B CA9916 (Hired Autos Specified as Covered Autos You Own) is an endorsement designed for use when long term leased autos are included as a scheduled auto. The endorsement provides Liability coverage on a primary basis vs. the excess cover typically provided on hired autos. CA9916B provided blanket coverage i.e. individual autos did not need to be identified on the schedule and it's use was intended to be restricted to accounts that frequently were adding and deleting long term leased autos during the policy term. Again, UW / LOB intent was that the endorsement was not to be provided on HNOA only policies. In TAP there was no edit to prevent attachment. In EPC there is an edit that prevents attachment.

__label__Package-Property Would you mind taking a look at account number 0118306740 for the 1/18 policy terms? I think the system may have an error in the property rate calculation.   There have been a lot of changes in values and locations from last year to this year.  With that said, when I go into rst for the 17-18 year and click on the property we are showing 6,030,000 tiv and $16,808 in premium.  That premium looks incorrect and is inconsistent with the premiums from the prior year and what is showing in rst.  It looks like it basically doubled the property premium as rst shows the property premium on the dashboard as 8,790.  The rate accordingly doubled from 16-17 to 17-18 but I don't think is accurate.  Thus, our rate this year looks like its half of last years rate when in reality the rate is pretty consistent with the exception of that 17-18 rst calculation where the premium does not look accurate. ​

Doing basic math and just dividing last year's premium by this this year's premium, that seems like it should be a 5% rate decrease. I will point out the e-mod decreased from 1.31 to .95 which is significant, but I increased the company code and added 11 or 12 scheduled pts of debits to offset.

__label__Workers-Comp FRC –Looking for a little guidance on the below experience mod split. We had quoted with just one experience mod throughout the entire year.

__label__Auto ​Good morning. I have a general question about Automobile coverage.  We have a current package policy that includes Hired/Nonowned Auto liability coverage (it's a Connect policy).  Insured has no owned vehicles.  They just purchased a small utility trailer (about $4,000 in value), and want to issue an auto policy to cover the trailer.  In Small Business, we have not written a trailer-only auto policy.  My thought is that liability for a trailer would fall upon the power unit that was pulling the trailer.  In this case, if they rented a vehicle to pull it, the H/NO coverage would respond.  The physical damage coverage for the trailer could be covered by the mobile equipment/personal property coverage on the Connect policy. The agent is pushing back a bit on this, so I'm looking for other opinions.  I've consulted with my fellow UDs in Small Business, and they are in agreement with me. Do you agree that would should not be writing a trailer-only auto policy, and that coverage should be outlined as I described above? Thank you!!

__label__Auto Hi Mike,I am a small business UT in Life Sciences and it was suggested I reach out to you for some guidance and possible answers to an issue I escalated to the help desk.We recently had an agent write an auto policy with us and he inquired why the PA PIP Supp App and the UM UIM Supp App did not attach to the policy.The UM/UIM form did. However, the PA 1st Party Benefits Supp App (G-144206-A) did not. In addition, there is also a vehicle garaged in FL that as far as I can tell means the FL  PIP Supp App (G-14545-G) should have also attached as my understanding is that this is also a state required form.The help desk is advising that the PA PIP only attaches to Auto policies issued with PA Garaged vehicles written through the 977 – CAN Health Pro Long Term Care Branch code.For the FL PIP Supp App they are advising the form is not in FMS, therefore not in TAP.

So now MA is all incorrect again.  Not sure what is happening over there, but we need to get these all corrected.

__label__Not-LOB-Specific I am just curious if there has been any thought to making us able to move a document to the correct policy or policy term in DMF without having each policy open up and having to scroll through all the documents?  So many people put the documents in the very first 'account' area instead of in the actual policy or policy term that they belong too.  So, when I pull up a policy, I try to put documents in the correct policy or at least the correct year.  If we don't, in 5 years, DMF is going to be a mess and we won't be able to find anything….there will be so much under that initial account tab, it will take forever to get to the actual policies.  When I try to move documents, every policy opens up and I have to scroll through all documents to get to the account I need.  EX:  Audit dept drops emails about the previous terms audit.  When I try to move it to the previous term, I have to scroll through ever single document for the current term to get to the previous one.  That can be quite lengthy sometimes.  In the account I am in there have been 23 auto endts so there is a LOT of information to scroll through. If there are several documents to move (which there usually is), this can take a long time to put them in the proper place.  Thanks for listening!

__label__Auto ​What's your thought?  I'd say I don't want to do this.  Another kind of funky request for this insured. They are looking to start a ride share program to promote their client's new vehicles (most likely Lincoln or Ford though I will confirm). It would be free of charge for the riders.They would be using independent contractors as drivers using LYFT. The program would be marketed on social media in local areas only. As of right now this would be a Michigan program only. The rides would only be on the weekends for up to 24 weeks and there would be approximately 10 vehicles on the per day.LYFT DOES provide coverage for the vehicles and drivers as soon as the passenger enters the vehicle and coverage stops when the passenger exits. They are looking for us to provide coverage that would fill the gap between the dealer lot (where the car would be picked up) and picking up a passenger then back to the dealership.Please let me know your thoughts and if you think we would be able to work something out.

__label__Package-Property ​Good Morning All, As I mentioned below that attached return premium endorsement was booked in Rapid on 12/15/17 (Rapid is showing the date). For some reason it was hung and didn't make it to TAP. The issue is that policy got cancelled after that and billing brought this issue later that agent has taken the credit.Santhi spent an hour to find the endorsement at the back end on Friday but it didn't help. If IT can search an endorsement at the back end and fix it, will be great otherwise I will have to re-instate the policy, rebook the endorsement, wait for couple of days to get the endorsement booked in TAP and again cancel the policy. In this scenario if I re-instate the policy and cancel again there could be a chance of duplication in return premium. Please advise.
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Team,On Integrated Medical, a New Business account for the Phoenix branch, I had originally priced it to .65 DFM on the GL, which was within branch authority and to a deviation from technical on the property that was within .25 – I believe it was a .23 but I don't have that number specifically written down.  RST was refreshed multiple times as further changes and adjustments were made, but the pricing structure stayed the same.  I then quoted the account.  When I went back to look at the pricing at the request of the agent, I noted that a few factors were not pulling through on the RST screen and ran a Refresh.  At this time the GL DFM dropped from a .65 to what it is currently and the technical premium increased, pushing the DFT to .31 or a .32.  I noticed the Property technical rate change first and tried to adjust UWS to see what it was actually reading as the correct premium.  The Technical premium changed again, increasing from a .07_ cent number to a .09_ cent number.  I need to understand what happened in terms of RST and the pricing. Account Number: 3033671783

__label__Workers-Comp ​I have a clarifying question around use of CA company tier sheets for any LOB.   Our understanding is that if you have a risk domiciled out of CA then the CA tier worksheet is required.  However, what if we have a MD domiciled risk that has CA operations and a separate CA WC policy, are tier sheets required for the separate CA WC policy?   Want to clarify this as there is some confusion since the risk isn't domiciled in CA in this scenario.  Thanks

__label__Workers-Comp Question.  I received the below message from WWO who was issuing a renewal policy for me.  When I did a search, the document told me to refer to the Named insured and mailing address job aid, but when I open that, it is the same document that referred me to the job aid in the first place.I took a look at the error to see if it is a blocking error and in EPC it shows that it is.  However, this same error showed up for last year's policy but no additional names were added to the policy and the policy got issued.  The blocking issue was cleared without the information being provided.  This is a multi-state attorney group.  Before I go back to the agent to try to get the information, I want to know why it was a blocking issue last year but got cleared without the information.

__label__Package-Property So I was right about the form generation J but then I made some more pricing adjustments and now its failing again in RST.Long story short, the first time I sent the policy to issuance, it got deleted because of an error in TAP – its 110 locations…yeah tell me about it.Anyways, anything you can do to work your magic on getting this fixed asap, would be awesome as I need to issue the policy for August…that is why I am emailing you this late and its $600k so management really wants it in the numbers.Feel free to ping/call me in the AM if you have questions. I can also send another email to the actual box if you need it.  Really appreciate your help!

__label__Package-General-Liability ​I need some help.  This account is a nightmare.  I know I just had your assistance on another change request that was a problem, but it appears there is another one. I have attached a copy of the endorsement request we received for a change to be effective 6/29/18.  We were to add a location for GL coverage only.  There was nothing else to be done.  This was the only change request eff. 6/29/18. The other 2 attachments are endorsements that were issued on the policy eff. 6/29/18 – both of them add the location in question however the one with a $3 addl premium (this one appears to be correct) also references 2 other locations that were not changed showing 0 premiums for the change.  The 2nd endorsement shows an $1861 return premium for the exact same changes shown above (adding the location to be added) but shows return premiums for the 2 locations above that should not have had anything done to them.  I have looked in TAP and the 2 locations that were not supposed to have anything done to them still have coverages which is the way they are supposed to be now.  I can only guess that the endorsement with the large return premium was discovered to be an error and the endorsement with the $3 AP was issued to correct it.  However, the agent received both changes and at this point is frustrated and confused because it appears a location was deleted that should not have been.  I have another change that needs to be made to the 17-18 term, but I do not want to send it to be done until I have answers to the above because it involves one of the 2 locations that were shown in the issued endorsements that should not have been included. If this was in fact, caught as an error, is there any communication sent to the agency to explain that they will be receiving an endorsement issued in error and to disregard it?  If it was in error, is direct bill notified not to return the $1861 to the insured? This account has just renewed and has a lot of endorsement activity that has already started to come in.  I would like to make sure we do not have issues with this account this year.

The Named Insured is not insured for liability arising out of the acts or omissions of other co-venturers, nor of their partners, members or employees.Is there any endorsement we can use (even if it's manuscript) to add some coverage for JVs?

This is in the context of Fast Track but I imagine it could expand to regular renewals as well. The questions are: Which states require tiering worksheets and should the UT know which states require tiering worksheets and should it be a part of the FT workflow for the UT check for these tiering worksheets when they identify the risk state is a state were tiering worksheets are required?Which lines require tiering worksheets?When there is a company change will the UWs need to fill out a tiering worksheet for each line of coverage for each state?  That could be a lot of worksheets.

__label__Auto Mike,following up yesterday's discussion with the details. I have included the email sent to Brian to provide some context and reference for the request.GKLLWe are currently providing GKLL on the account for coaches/busses which are in for service or repairs ( these are not owned by Liberty coach) The risk has 3 separate locations but 5 addresses which somewhat complicates the issue in the manner the policy has to be issued to provide coverage for each of the locations.Here is that I am proposing, whether we use a symbol 10 or a manuscript text, does not matter as long as there is clarity on what we are providing and then assuring that the reinsurance market cover it the same wayLocation 1  - 1400 MORROW AVE, NORTH CHICAGO IL 60064Location 2  - 2222 SEYMOUR, NORTH CHICAGO IL 60064Location 3  - (one building 3 addresses) 1311-1331 MORROW , 1341 MORROW  and , 2325 DAVIS STREETLimit of 5 mil (Comp & Collision) primary coverage with 5,000 dedthe other aspect of the coverage we would like to include for the GKLL via symbol 10 is to provide collision coverage while on a test drive (which is a limitation of the GKLL form)Dealer Plates (2)coverage for liability is on the auto, while the busses are being built/converted covered by the property,  each of the busses/coaches will be driven from the main location to a painting shop in Indiana.  In all 15 busses are converted each year which translated into 15 trips to and back from Indiana using dealer plates.  What we need to cover is comprehensive and collision while being driven with a dealer plate or at the location being paintedI think that using a symbol 10 for comp & collision and specifying the coverage intent is the cleanest way to provide the coveragePlease let me know if there are any question on the coverage intent. As far as the premium charge, GKLL will be charges as files, the other 2 items the auto pricing is going up 10% which equates to $4,000 additional premium.Thanks in advance for your assistance.

__label__Package-Property ​Team, Can you please look into the renewal pricing changes for this account's PMT policy? The GL for NY was rated off of ISO class codes last year and so Rule 34 was used as a justified tool.  Our anticipation was that this year, now using PGL class codes for NY, that we would not need to use that.  Based on the renewal indications from RST, the rates seem approximately the same this year with PGL class codes.  Also the written tier indication will not pull through.  Please advise why this may be?The property rate is up 38.3% this year and we are maxed out in NF and.85 schedule credits.  With no changes to the property at renewal, we obviously cannot sell a 38% increase.  Can you please advise the cause for the heavy rate increase?

It would be nice for any Fast Track renewals.Does the UT have to have written approval from the Underwriter to mark the Disposition in EPC as approved for the renewal to be processed? If they were both to match that would be the approval the UT would need to mark the Disposition as approved and no further documentation would be required.

So in EPC,  I am in rate status, my experience is not locked and I am on the UWI screen under prior losses.    My issue is that I do not see how to enter the loss info in epc.  Nothing opens up for me to enter loss info. I am sure its user input error (me) but Christina did not know what is wrong either.   Any help you could give me would be appreciated. 3 years of loss history is not being utilized in the dashboard results for policy 6045668665.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Hello, Do we know if there will be new POR procedures put  into place based on this change.  The current POR procedure does not allow us to change the producer mid-term so how would we have the commission paid to the new agent?  Also, who determines which agent will service the accounts for the remainder of the term?  Same with the installments, endorsements and audit premiums, who determines that?  There are a lot of questions with regards to processing the POR as updated, and should really be addressed in the POR procedures before or at the same time the new letter is placed in DMF. Communication on changes should also need to be sent out.  Most UT's don't check the POR procedures each time they process one to see if anything changed, and there is a possibility that the updated letter is not even noticed by the UT and could be sent out saying you or the new agent. I just want to make sure that everything that needs changed is changed and that the enterprise is made aware of the changes coming.

__label__Workers-Comp ​I am looking for some input on this one.Dear Ramona, I understand your communication. I am disagreeing with your findings.  We are the broker.  We MUST rely upon the policy form issued by the carrier for all terms and conditions.  We have never received any notice from CNA indicating which of our insured's returned their Officers Exclusion forms and what clients did not. Absent a subsequent policy endorsement, the policy form, as issued by CNA, governs the contract between the insured and the insurer.  Processing time, volume and compliance changes don't change the terms and conditions of an insurance contract. I hate to keep going in circles with you on this. I am happy to forward you a signed exclusion form but this must retro to January 1, 2017.

__label__Monoline ​Hello – I have an international policy that was issued by me in Middle Market for a MM account. I am not sure how I can look up the policy documents electronically myself – but there appears that a coverage page was included to the agency that showed incorrect effective dates and address. What is also strange is when I look up the policy in Common Customer lookup in ECF I see the policy number is 6023303958. This all seems correct: But then when I click the Merlin reporting icon next to the policy number it pulls up a another Large Property policy that seems to share the same policy number. One is MM PST and one Large Property:When I go into CNA Central to look up my PST policy all I can find is the large property policy. My question is twofold:Is there another way for MM UW's to look up the policy documents for MM issued Passport policies?Is there something wrong with these two unrelated accounts having the same policy number, and possibly that is why the coverage page on the agencies copy of my PST policy showed different information?

__label__Umbrella ​Hey Folks. I ran into a problem that IT can't fix.  CUE policy was issued as direct bill 25 + 9.  Should have been issued agency bill, 10 equal installments.Correction re-issue was processed on CUE and all of the installment due dates are showing the inception date (1/1/18). This means that the policy is on full pay with all of the premium due at one time (1/1/18). IT indicated this morning that there isn't a way to fix this.  It's my understanding that the installment due dates can't be fixed on billing's end, either. If there is a solution other than cancelling the policy flat and issuing under a new number, please advise.If cancelling is the only solution, please advise that as well.

And cancel the old policy with all the endorsements?Hi Jason, I want to talk through this account with you when you have a moment.  I'm not really sure what we should agree to with the agent and want to talk to you about preferred ways to move forward. Long story short as I understand it, this large account (~$400k for the GL) was written a couple of years ago and the agent agreed to place with CNA understanding that endorsements would be handled on an individual basis (I wasn't a part of the deal at the time, I'm not sure how it went down, but that's my understanding).  Fast forward 2 years and the agency team on the account has changed and the endorsement situation is a bit of a mess: agent and UW are unsure what endorsements do what, when they were requested, etc.  I don't think it's all our fault at all as endorsement requests come from all over the place from the agent too.  The agent is now interested in backing out of all endorsements on the 16/17 and 17/18 term and switching to being auditable (or at least with an annual true-up).  We have some other large real estate accounts like this that we do quarterly reporting on.  For this one specifically, what are your thoughts on backing everything out on the prior and current terms and going to a more auditable or annual reporting structure?  This has a 9/1 effective date, so of course retaining the renewal is already an item of interest J Thanks for your help, we can chat whenever is convenient for you.  Robbie Mauney, CIC, CRM

__label__Package-General-Liability Hello,Commercial Underwriting Authority Statements have been updated and authority for the Connect Small Business product is no longer available to Middle Market Underwriters.  As a result, we have several renewals that either need to be transferred to Small Business (stay on the Connect Product) or converted to Paramount in Middle Market.  I've worked with Small Business to identify which accounts can be transferred so there is some relief but not all of our renewals are eligible for Small.  With that said, we have to send appropriate legal notice on these renewals given we are changing forms.  What boiler plate language can we use in our Conditional Renewal Notices to facilitate and relay the message that we are converting from Connect to Paramount?  Your assistance is appreciated.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hi Ernst, The above is a 1m+ enterprise account that we wrote as new business last year.  For the renewal Marsh is being asked to find WC coverage for independent contractors and talent that they contract with.  My understanding is that independent contractors could be picked up under our policy if they do not have their own insurance; but what if they do have their own insurance but Edelman is responsible to provide them with insurance for a specific event / contract?  Would Edelman simply record the payroll and then provide it to us on audit? Can you give me your thoughts?  I'm going to discuss with Marsh on Monday to get some more details around the request but did want to get this on your radar. Thanks,Adele

__label__Auto Hello –I have a renewal policy 6049909702 which is composite rated. This was new business last year. The business owns a motorhome which is scheduled on the auto policy. Last year we did not have stated amount on the vehicle. This year, EPC requires the stated amount in lieu of ACV. It is strange though because the statement amount endorsement lists the vehicle specifically and the amount. The policy will be composite rated, so it does not have any vehicles actually scheduled anywhere else. Since this is composite rated I wanted to double check this is correct, and given that last year we didn't have stated amount I would like to be consistent if possible. Thank you!The vehicle  is #1 Damon Challenger.

__label__Workers-Comp Hi FRC, I have a question related to audits. One of my renewal accounts has two states on their WC policy. In year's past, we have limited the total payroll for the state of MI based on the attached PAAS Audit document, and limited the payroll to the max provided for the given state. My question is when we would limit the payroll? In addition, how much should payroll be limited by. For instance, if the policy says they have two executive officers at a location in North Carolina and provide a total payroll of 250,000, how much would be utilized for rating? Per the attached, Max NC payroll per week for an executive officer is $1,700. Multiplied by 52 weeks and we come to $88,400. Would we use this value, or possible double this value since there are more than one officers at the location?

__label__Monoline ​Good morning Karen and team, I have a very time sensitive communication that needs to go out to the Operations group with regards to boiler inspection fines in NYC. Information:  Once a year, NYC sends out violations for all boilers that have not been inspected and filed within a certain calendar year.  The beginning of this week, the 2016 violations were mailed out to the locations where the boiler resides.  Having these violations researched and resolved in a timely manner is of the utmost importance due to the severity of the fines, $1,000 per boiler.While a large portion of these violations will be in the Northeast, any account in the country could have these violations if there is a New York City location on the policy. (Property policies that include EB.)Attached is a copy of what the violation looks like.  If any of these come across an UW or UT desk they should be handled as follows:Find applicable policy number.Check the calendar year the violation is from, and make sure the location with the violation was a covered location during that time period.Once you know whether or not the location was covered, forward the email including the policy number and location validity finding to Jeanie Ubhaus (Jeanie.ubhaus@cna.com) for researching the inspection piece.Subject line should read 2016 Violation (Insured Name) (Location address) and (Policy #) Please let me know if you have questions, and please let me know if this is something you should be sending out or if it something I should send out to the Ops leadership team to distribute to their UT's.  Thank you,

__label__Package-General-Liability ​ I have a rate change question on GL & Auto. This is a renewal that the broker requested two option quotes for. Option 1: was a true renewal that was a renewal of all exposures we originally had on our policy. Option 2 was all of option 1 + exposures for two extra entities. The broker decided to go with option 1, and I just had WWO take out all the additional exposures from option 2 in order to get back to our first quoted premium. When I first played with pricing of option 1 we had an account rate decrease of -10% and the GL/Auto rate decrease was no more than -10% I believe. It is now showing as -27% and -60%. I am guessing this is because we had taken out a lot of exposures going from option 2 to 1. However is there a way to fix this rate decrease so it shows the true rate decrease from our current policy to our option 1 renewal quote? Thanks!

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello Debra, The FSR department does not file WC policies to provide proof of coverage or verify filing for proof of coverage. All Workers Compensation files electronically for all carriers through WCPOLS by issuance of the policy or endorsement. There is no manual filing. NCCI and the states will only accept the electronic filing which is produced by issuance of the policy or endorsement. The electronic feed goes out in a batch to NCCI and the states in the evening. NCCI accepts or rejects the policy the next day. Independent states have different schedules on when they accept the information usually 3-7 business days. Please review the policy, link the names to the proper states, correct any incorrect Name, FEIN or UI # and issue the endorsement to file the proof of coverage with the state. Coverage can be verified on the NY Proof of Coverage website: http://www.wcb.ny.gov/icpocinq/icpocsearch.jsp What feeds electronically for proof of coverage?  If any of these items are incorrect on the issued policy the insured is uninsured. •           Name and legal entity –Must be an employing entity in the USA. •           Registered FEIN –Electronic filing for proof of coverage is by the FEIN number. Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number (EIN) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. A FEIN Number is registered for each named insured. Two named insured cannot share the same FEIN. •           Registered Unemployment number - ME,MN,NY,RI,UT.  HI requires a DOL# and NJ requires a NJTIN •           Class code, payroll. •           The information will only be fed to the state the Name is linked to on the policy. Each Named insured and FEIN, listed on the policy, must be linked to the state location or locations where it is registered to file proof of coverage. A name can be linked to multiple state locations. This information must match what the insured registered with the State Labor Bureau and WC bureau or it will be rejected.

__label__Auto ​Good morning Autumn, When applying schedule credit and debit to the auto policy within EPC you also need to verify is the physical damage/liability qualifies. Per the below screen shot both schedule modifiers are not eligible therefore, the policy only qualifies for a 15% schedule credit or debit per the below document insert.  Also see the Did you know attached email for more information. My policy was eligible for a Physical Damage credit but not Liability, and I used the Propagation feature on the Modifiers screen to apply a 5% schedule credit to all states on my policy, selecting All under Propagate Value to Coverages. I noticed the credit was applied to all states on my policy, even for the Liability coverages where I was not eligible for a schedule credit. Is this an error?No: for most states, you are allowed to offer up to a 15% schedule mod even when NOT eligible for ISO experience and schedule rating. Then if eligible, you may be able to exceed that 15%. Additionally, when propagating schedule credits, you have the option to apply to all coverages, to Liability coverages only, or to Physical Damage coverages only. When you select All to propagate to all coverages, EPC will apply the schedule credit to both Liability and Physical Damage coverages (within the allowable range). Sincerely,

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello, I am hoping you can help with the situation we are having below. Please see attached documentation involving this endorsement transaction. A brief synopsis of what occurred: Agent requested we increase payrolls on this account after they had a mid-term meeting with the client and were advise their payrolls have increased and they do not want to be hit with a large audit. When we sent this to be endorsed, they applied a pro-rata factor to the payrolls for the remainder of the term (3/25/18-10/1/18). After the endorsement was processed the agent came back and was confused on why this wasn't applied from inception ( I agreed), so we sent this back to amend increased payrolls back to inception (to be cleaner, and to ensure there will be no A/P come audit time). Per the below, we were made aware that we have cancel/re-write this policy in order to accommodate amending the payrolls back to inception? Is a cancel/re-write necessary? Any work around available? This is a long term, and profitable insured and would like to avoid having to communicate a cancel/re-write if possible.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​ Hi:  This is a 10/31 renewal that we have written since 2014.  Primary state is NY so this is going from ISO to PGL as of the 10/31/18 renewal date.   I have rated with different company placements, different mods and I keep coming up with a rate change of about minus 20%.  I understand how the RST rate change calculation is supposed to be accurate in that it rates the expiring against the renewal exposures, etc... My issue is that in terms of pure rate changes when comparing individual expiring rates against the renewal rates, there really is not that much of a rate change (but RST shows -20).  I'm going to be hard pressed to sell a flat rate change (per RST) to the agent because, in reality, when they compare the rates, they will be seeing rate changes in the +20% range (on a profitable account).  Conversely, I cannot have RST showing a -20% rate decrease on the renewal.  Is there a chance that the rate change calculation is inaccurate due to the conversion from ISO to PGL in NY?  (I can send you a comparison that shows the rate comparison by code for 17-18 vs 18-19 to show you what I mean if you'd like).  Thanks for your help.

__label__Package-General-Liability The Technology GLEE endorsement provides AI coverage to various interests as shown on the specimen copy of the form attached.  Frequently due to contractual requirements our insured will request that a customer be named specifically on an AI endorsement.  Currently the only way that we can effect this is via a CG2010, which requires either a premium charge or using a work around.  Very difficult to charge for something such as this when we are already making a charge for the GLEE and providing the required coverage on a blanket basis.  We recently obtained a BOR on a small business account and in reviewing the CNP policy I noticed that there is a schedule of AI's that identifies the insurable interest and names each on the schedule.  I am inquiring as to whether middle market package & GL policies could handle this in a similar fashion.  To assist in the review of this, I am attaching a copy of the 1st page of the Additional Insured schedule.  Please advise if this is a viable solution for middle market. Thank youDiane
__label__Umbrella ​Linda asked me the same question that was asked to Josh.  I told her what Josh writes below even before she sent me the email. I also explained why we wouldn't want to write two month policies.She was going to cancel and rewrite.---------------------------------------------------------------Carrie, This is a tough one, but here are my thoughts: Our filing does include a minimum per layer which does apply regardless of the length of the policy term.  If the minimum is more than the prorated premium, the minimum would apply.EPC does not allow policy extensions after a policy has been issued.  That's why the PSR is unable to process this request.  We do this because we don't collect the appropriate premium for the exposure when we offer a whole new set up limits after 12 months.The best way to resolve this issue is to cancel / rewrite the entire umbrella policy.  Cancel the expired term and rewrite it with effective dates of 8/31/17-10/31/18.  You can then use judgement mod to get your overall pricing close to the quoted premium (expired premium + $1,247).  If the PSR gets an error (as described below), they should submit an IT ticket to get resolved.  Note that there may need to be a delay between the time we cancel the old policy and quote the new one. Note that we would not be collecting appropriate premium, but this is the only way I can think of to honor the quote. Let me know if you need anything else. Josh

__label__Umbrella ​While waiting for EPC to be updated , how should we be handling issuance? If we leave as the system is currently set up, the Endorsement Team will be required to process a canc/rewrite when an entity other than the insured is requesting Notice of Cancellation for more than 20 days. Should we override the cancellation days to 60? If we change to anything lower, we'd be reducing the cancellation days for the insured. We'd previously gotten direction to change to 45 days for construction accounts as they have the higher incidence of requests for Notice of Cancellation. Please advise.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Hi Udo, Just wanted to ask for your help in escalating an incident that I have identified is impacting a multiple users in the N Zone and potentially other Zones as well.This is potentially a major issue with far reaching downstream impact to operations. There appears to be some system issue which is blocking the ability of EPC to reassign endorsements to PSRs for processing after UTs/UWs are approving the endorsements. The problem we are facing is that if this problem persists, it will stall the ability of our PSRs to complete endorsements timely. A couple days without any approved endorsements could create a bottleneck effect that could cause even longer delays in processing depending on how widespread this issue is. I'm copying the EPC Team for awareness as well. Hoping we can fix this before it gets out of hand. Best,JSP Jason, Working on a few endorsements now and just had the same issue. After approving the endorsement, it was assigned back to me. I'm not even seeing a way to assign it to a PSR. Jonathan D. Gudeman

__label__Monoline ​ISSUANCE PROBLEM---this is an Equipment Dealer. The expiring policy has 10 locations with a manuscript endorsement that properly lists the locations and limits. HOWEVER, the policy also attaches G-55230-C 11 times. The total limits of coverage is $40M, but if you total up all the limits G-55230-C lists, we show a total policy limit of $86M. Also, we show $1,350,000 under Property Not At Your PREMISES , this is wrong. It should be $450,000. I attached a scanned copy of one of the G-55230 showing what is wrong. I have the renewal BIND ORDER- as expiring. I am having Denethia task the renewal. My request for WWO and Field Resources, is how do we get the $86M off the Equipment Dealer Schedule. Is there something on the processing end that we can do to fix this????? If not, I'd suggest revising G-56015 as per the attached. At least this way claims would know what the true limits are. Please let me know what you end up doing to fix the problem.

We wrote their WC insurance up until 04/01/2018 when we lost the account. The mod that was used on 01/01/2018 was .64 per the NCCI report below.

PST 67 293 0965 eff. 7/16/18-7/1/19 policy term Importance: High Dear Annette & Barbara, WWO sent this account to my attention due to the following issues: The binder is reflecting an incorrect K&R premium for this account.    It appears that you bound our Level 3 Territory Endorsement for a $5M K&R limit for a premium totaling $815.   The correct annual premium for that territory endorsement and limit is $3,189.      When we upsell the higher K&R limit we maintain the $2,500 annual premium for the Package policy and add the upsold K&R premium to the $2,500 total.  For this account this means that the annual premium should be $5,689 ($2,500 minimum premium plus $3,189 K&R premium).   The K&R Underwriting Manual in the Resource Library confirms this approach and all of our Underwrites are required to follow those guidelines. The premium for the Passport policy needs to be pro-rated for the 7/16/18 – 7/1/19 policy term.    For this account it means that the premium would be $5,445 (i.e. $5,689 annual premium x .959 pro-rata factor). Please note that we cannot make an exception to revise the Passport premium to $3,117 for this account.     Please revise your binder to reflect the correct premiums due of $5,445 and please resubmit the binder to WWO along with the completed EZ Rater so that they can complete the policy issuance for this Insured.   If necessary you will need to revise your domestic policy premium for this account to make up for the difference in premium due under the Passport policy (so that the overall account premium bound does not change for this placement).  If you have any further questions or concerns on this matter please contact the Field Resource Center for support.    Thank you. Regards,Chris Brutzman, CPCU, AUAVP – International Product Leader International - U.S. OperationsCNA500 College Road East, Suite 401Princeton, New Jersey 08540(p) 609-524-6571 (c) 917-771-7761

__label__Auto ​Good Morning,I wanted to bring to your attention a situation a Middle Market UT observed as she completed a new Auto Schedule Rating Worksheet for the renewal term. Although she is working the 2/1/2018 term, the worksheet defaulted to a policy effective date of 02/01/2017. While she had it filed in the appropriate term in EPC, we are concerned about any audit issues that may come in to play with the wrong effective date on the bottom (see attachment.) Can you investigate and fix? Thank you!Caroline

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello Lissa, When reaching out for assistance, please don't copy the FSR Department. The FSR department does not file WC policies with the state bureaus or process criticisms. What date is the insured showing coverage in the NY proof of coverage website? All Workers Compensation files electronically for all carriers through WCPOLS by issuance of the policy or endorsement. NCCI and the states will only accept the electronic filing which is produced by issuance of the policy or endorsement. The electronic feed goes out in a batch to NCCI and the states in the evening. NCCI accepts or rejects the policy the next day. Independent  states have different schedules on when they accept the information usually 3-7 business days. If you receive this type of fine letter from an agent/insured please review the policy, link the names to the proper states, correct any incorrect Name, FEIN or UI # and issue the endorsement to file the proof of coverage with the state. Please see the attached Proof of Coverage document Thank you,

__label__Monoline ​FRC, We have had several instances with Out of Sequence endorsements that have been causing confusion with agents and the field.  When an out of sequence endorsement is processed on an IM coverage such as CE, MTCLL etc ,the print is showing future affected premiums on the first page of the endorsement print (see below). To correct this, the following day after we process the OOS endt, we have to go into every endorsement processed prior to the effective date of the out of sequence endt and update to include the OOS endt processed.  In this case the last endt was processed effective 12/05/2017 and the new endt was eff 10/31/17. Here is the workflow we have for OOS endts:http://refdocs.cna.com/WorkplaceXT/getContent?objectStoreName=kbos&id=release&objectType=document&vsId=%7BC0D12457-0400-C8ED-B9AB-5E0C5DAE77AD%7DThe workflow notes that we process one endt per day but this doesn't alleviate the print concern with the future effected premium. I'm trying to see if there is a fix that can be put in the system so this stops print out this way, and it doesn't require rework after the initial endt is processed the next day/subsequent days.Processing Multiple Out of Sequence Endorsements:Once you have all of the endorsement requests for an account, determine which request has the oldest effective date.Process the oldest effective date endorsement first.Process all the endorsements in order.Continue in date order until all of the endorsement requests are completed. If you need to process endorsements out of sequence, you should only process them one a day. Multiple OOS prints may cause confusion for the agent and in mobius if processed in the same day or may not print. I have included the response from the help desk trying to close and I sent back that nothing had been done. IT Incident:This is an e-mail to notify you that an incident has been opened on your behalf.  A summary of your incident is below for your reference.Incident Number: INC0504007Priority: 4 - MinimalTitle: Out of Sequence endorsements causing future premiums which confuse agents and u/w'sDescription: Tier 1: PAS/Agency Help Desk, Processing Applications Tier 2: TAP Tier 3: TAP, OtherEnter policy # & Policy Type: 6043371382-IM-Motor Truck Cargo 6043642876-IM-Builders Risk5095760574-IM-Motor Truck Cargo 6018372572-IM-Medical & Scientific Equipment 6049989356-IM-Contractor's EquipmentTransaction type: Out of Sequence Endorsements Descrpt. of problem: When ever we process OOS endt's we get future premium pages on the first page of the endt which confuses everyone because the correct billing is on the last page. To correct these we have to go in and do the same endorsement on every date that comes up with a future premium that was processed with a date in advance of our effective date. This happens mostly on IM blanket coverage's, list on file equipment, and motor truck cargo coverage's. I have included the policy numbers of several types of coverage's that have this situation. We believe this is a defect and are looking for a permanent solution going forward. Thank you, PAS Help Desk  Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

Any information on what is still owed and why we did not receive notice would be greatly appreciated.-----------------------------------------------------Dottie provided the details:Cancellation notice for umbrella was sent Sept 25th,   New is $9821.50   Date of Cancellation is 10/15/2018Auto – Notice sent Sept 25th and amount due is $4447.86  Date to cancel is 10/15/2018WC same as above but amount due is $98,708.55There is a notice for PMT  due $32,057.08  that cancel date is not until 10/29/2018  
__label__Workers-Comp ​FRC – please advise why RST indicates rate decrease, see email below.Jeff Brudnick is hoping we can get him indications on this renewal next week.  It's a fast track account, but I want to collaborate with you a bit because it needs rate this year.  The first thing I'm hoping you might be able to help me sort out is the WC rate.  The e-mod is up from .81 to .93, however, RST is still showing a 7% rate decrease.  That seems pretty strange and I'm wondering if you might be able to try to help me figure out why that is the case?  
__label__Package-General-Liability Hi FRC team,Could you please help us find out what happened on the original requests for these endorsements on the PMT and CUE?  Per the email chain below, the endorsements have been requested multiple times but the UW wasn't able to even see the request in the system.I'm hoping we can determine if there was an issue in getting the requests imaged or if there was some other sort of error involved.Thanks!Carrie

__label__Auto Good Morning,It is my understanding that Auto Loan/Lease Gap coverage is only written on a per vehicle basis.  Is that correct?  The way we handle the coverage has recently been causing a few issues from a marketing standpoint.  Most of our competitors are now offering the coverage either in an extension endorsement or on a blanket basis.  When working on a new business, agents have difficulty getting the information for individual vehicles when the coverage is currently written on a blanket basis.  I just worked on one yesterday where the current carrier is Travelers and they were offing the coverage on a blanket basis. My suggestion is to add the coverage to the BA-Plus endorsement.  As far as I know, that endorsement is rated based from a range of percentages in most states.  The underwriter would then have the flexibility to adjust the rate depending on the exposure. Thanks,

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello,Please see attached. Could you please add the information below to the Resource Library? An endorsement request to exclude Executive Officers was sent and we could not exclude them due to the Legal Entity for the first named insured name is an LP. The Endorsement Team questioned so would like something in Resource Library to clarify. The EPC system is also malfunctioning due to the system says that Executive Officers are Included and it allowed me to override to Exclude. The exclusion form also generated but the wording is for Sole Proprietors instread of Executive Officer or Partner-See screen shots below. The system should not have allowed any of this if we are going by the Legal Entity-LP.  Please add the following information to the Resource Library:Check the first named insured's Legal Entity to determine which column to use. Ex: If Legal Entity is LP(Limited Partner), then use the Partners column. The endorsement request may state the names they are wanting to exclude are officers and not partners, however, follow the first named insured's Legal Entity to determine which column to use in order to determine if the names can be excluded or not.   WC Sole Proprietors Partners and Officers Coveragehttps://intranet.cna.com/web/user/home/mybriefcase/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8zivTydPQ2cLYx8DAJdLA0cXYwCzPxCnA2AQD8cVYGFl5-zgaOPobdHgFegkYGnoX4UMfoNcABHA-L041EQhd_4cP0oVCvQfAByAV4FIC8SsqQgNzQ0wiDTEwCkLt0b/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/#Added the excluded override just to test itSee Resource Library below.The State Law field will populate with the state law for the title in the applicable state. Ex: If Executive Officers are automatically Included for a state, Included will appear in the State Law Field. No Manual Override is permitted for this field. If the request is to Include or Exclude a Partner, Officer, etc….and the State Law field indicates that the entity is already automatically Included or Excluded (per your request), there is no need to add the state to the policy

__label__Auto Looking for a little clarity on my auto rate change. When I initially sent this to UW for review, the rate change on the auto was 10% increase. Nothing was changed on the policy, but when I pulled it up today the rate was showing it was increased to 18.9%. Nothing on the policy was changed between the originally quoted date to today. Also, no exposure changes are present. I did bump up the company and adjust credits from last year to get to what was a 10% rate. When I pulled up RST with the 18.9% increase, I dropped the 10 debits off the auto line and that brought the rate change to 10%. This really doesn't make sense to me as the premiums are almost identical. I'm really jkust curious as to how the RST rate changed from 10% to almost 19%?

__label__Package-Property Great memory.  We had this problem last year with NYS. Sakthivel – Another Assumed Reinsurance policy, category code three, is showing incorrectly on the production report. Please manually correct this policy to show as NEW business in Merlin.  Account Number is 0125979688, Policy Number is 6023354912, Effective 4-1-18.  Ticket number is: INC0575245Field Resource Center – Can you get this fixed?Last year we found:Not all Category code 3 are marked as 'X' in Merlin. There is a logic to look for supplemental data if the category code is 3. Based on which, it is categorized as New, Renewal or Other (X).(decode(substr(SPPLTL_DATA,79,1),'1','N','2','R','3','N','4','R','X')),'X') as NEW_RENEWAL_CDMerlin look for the 80th position in the supplemental data (SPPLTL_DATA) from the PES feed and determines the New/Renewal code.For this policy, there is no value in 80th position and it defaulted to 'X'. Hence Merlin is showing as X – other premium for this policy.In summary, Assumed Reinsurance New Business does not show in Merlin as new business. TAP is not sending the required information to PES -> Merlin for LP and SRP Assumed Reinsurance policies.Thanks,

__label__Auto ​Here is the deal with this one. The account normally ran 10/17 to 10/17. However we wrote the entire account 10/17/17 to 10/17/18. Mid-term we lost the Auto and WC. Both policies were cancelled short rate. Now, we are quoting the other lines that are renewing effective 10/17/18 PMT, CPM & CUE. The agent is wanting us to quote the Auto and WC again effective 10/17/18. In EPC I am not able to input loss information under manually input for the term we lost the two lines which is 7/1/18. I need a line in there to show a loss for Glass. Which would be 7/1/18 to 10/17/18. The losses from the prior policy did pull over into EPC. But, it is not recognizing that policy was cancelled 7/1/18. Then the curve ball is that they are wanting all lines to expire 7/1/19. So, I am not able to get EPC to let me input that short term listed above in there to experience rate.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Field Resource Team – The above WC policy is a 5/1 new business which we are in the process of setting up for issuance.  The last quote sent out by the Underwriter was on 4/27/18 and the WC premium at that time was $39,828.  Today, I went into EPC to add the Pay as you Go Contact information to the Policy Level Information document.  When I hit the re-rate button the premium increased to $41,001.  I checked the current quote against the quote from the underwriter and see that rates changed for three (3) PA classes on the quote.  My question is what happened in the system between the last quote of 4/27 and my re-rating today that would cause the rates to change.  Are the rates on the revised quote now correct?  If yes, when did that rate change hit the EPC system? The class code which show a rate change are as follows: 0659 – rate changed from 25.01 to 25.820951 – rate changed from .48 to .430454 – rate changed from 4.22 to 4.13 I require this information as I will have to explain to the Underwriter and the Underwriter to the Agent why the rate/premium change happened now.

__label__Package-General-Liability I have a few drone related questions for this renewal (cited above).First, is NY a flat rate state for drone rating on GL or is it a pure-A state?  I had hoped to charge $500 per drone (there are 4), but the way it appears in TAP is making me thinking that we have no flexibility and the rate is flat $250 per drone.Second, I'm hoping to include drone coverage under the Umbrella line as well.  Ideally I would like to sublimit the Umbrella coverage for drones to $2M.  Per the correspondence chain below, I was initially under the impression we could accomplish this via CNA90072, but it seems that did not work out.  Is there an alternative approach to sublimiting the drone coverage?Whether we sublimit the Umbrella or not, do I need to add CNA87650XX to go along with the GL endorsement (CNA80838XX)?

Therefore, trying to process this so that the form would generate is generating an additional premium of $34.  I don't think McGriff is going to be happy with the $34 as they think the premium already included the VT UM.  Is there any way to waive this $34 or add the form without the charge.

__label__Umbrella ​Hello~ We have yet another situation of EPC removing an endorsement when I go in to make a change that has nothing to do with the endorsement being removed.  In this case, I was amending a policy number on the Schedule of Underlying, and EPC removed the Contractors Limitation Endorsement-CNA 75575XX….I know this happened to one of my prior policies with this same endorsement.  I looked in my files to see if there was a work-around for this particular issue and was not able to find anything.  I also thought this issue had been corrected.  Flad AffiliatedPolicy Number: 5094636998 Please have fixed in EPC so I can process the endorsement, you will find the Locked Work Order in the account. Thanks~
__label__Workers-Comp The endorsement was done effective 04/01/18. The UW would like to apply more schedule credit to MI to give back around $2300 . I went in to do an optional quote to play with  the schedule so I could tell WWO exactly what credit to apply and the field does not open up to adjust. I was under the impression that we shouldn't be doing mid-term endorsements. Is there a way to open the field up?
__label__Package-General-Liability Hello: Can you please advise regarding the below.  Itron inc should have been added as AI - financial interest.  It looks like it was, but the endorsement also shows that form was deleted.  Also, itron networked solutions was added and deleted on the same endorsement - it should have just been added.  I don't know if this is a mistake in the endorsement processing or if the endorsement just displays incorrectly.  Thank you.  
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Good Afternoon, There was an extension made to the expiring term for the following 3 policies: PLO 6046476256BUA 6023184308PMT 6046476273Account #3032314286 We extended the expiring term by 1 month (from 5/1/17 - 5/1/18 to 5/1/17 - 6/1/18).  We need to have RST updated to reflect this information. Ticket: INC0575227
__label__Package-General-Liability Hello –For the state of California, I have looked at ODEN and it states that if a rate increase is 25% or more, we need to issue a conditional renewal notice.  My question is, is this per line of business or overall account rate increase?When I pulled up the template in EPC, it doesn't appear to have per line of business to select on the notice, so I thought it might be for an overall account increase, but I wanted to confirm.Thanks!

__label__Workers-Comp Hello,Can you assist in the below inquiry?  The agent is asking what generates the Premium Discount – Stock on WC policies.  My understanding is that a discount is provided on larger policies, in the form of Premium Discount – Stock, due to the administrative cost savings associated from large policies.  I am not certain of this, however, and would like to be sure prior to advising.
__label__Umbrella ​I have pulled all of the correct policies into RST, then calculated and saved the CUE.  When I go into EPC to rate the CUE policy it is telling me Exception: RST Premium Data is not available. Please check that the correct policy is selected in RST and verify that it has been successfully rated. If the problem persists, contact production support.Exception occurred at 02/02/2018 7:08 AM. Stack trace available in server log file. Can you please have this issue fixed so we can rate the CUE in EPC and quote.
__label__Workers-Comp Middle Markets does not own EPC/DMF.  If you have your settings set up to receive emails I believe you will get notification on each policy whenever an activity is updated. The Field Resource Center will be able to better assist you with your question.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello Emily, The letter from NY is not attached so I can't give you an exact answer. If NY is looking for coverage for Vibram USA, then an ERM-14 will need to be sent to NY to show the name change. If there were mid-term changes or out of sequence endorsements, it will effectively remove coverage from inception to the date of the endorsement for NY. For this a ticket would need to be placed with the Help Desk. At this time, the only name linked to the NY location is Vibram Corporation and the NY Unemployment number was not added. There is an activity assigned to Karen Smorol to update the UI number in EPC dated 6/11/18 that has not been completed. Once a policy is issued or corrected via endorsement, you can check proof of coverage on the NY website: http://www.wcb.ny.gov/icpocinq/icpocsearch.jsp  For proof of coverage, the following must be correct on the policy: What feeds electronically for proof of coverage?  If any of these items are incorrect on the issued policy the insured is uninsured. •           Name and legal entity –Must be an employing entity in the USA. •           Registered FEIN –Electronic filing for proof of coverage is by the FEIN number.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Team, please assist to my inquiry below regarding premium changes for the WC policy #6024413388 bound for 5/2/18-19 renewal.  Let me know if any questions.....  Hi Team, I have attached the quoted premiums for this May 1, 2018 renewal.  I revised the rating to remove New York from the policy.  In doing so, my premium changed from $15,633 to $16,886.  That's a $1253 additional premium.  I have attached the worksheets from EPC.  As the norm here lately, the rates changed and the terrorism premium went up, which we know happens.  The Expense Constant was on DC, but now on Maryland, which the payroll is rated on if any and the $240 expense constant is now charged there. Please review the attached and advise if there is something wrong with the way this Workers Comp policy is rated. Other UT's have noted the expense constant dropping off and of course the rates and terrorism premium changing. Thanks for your review and response. 
__label__Package-Property Hello,Matt Lange reached out to me about an issue with the rater due to the CAT Pricing Tool output.  The user had entered the same layer twice - it appears they imported the files and then manually added the same layer. The model was run by Lorraine Ellington for the account FUSCO MANAGEMENT COMPANY LLC.  Can someone from the FRC reach out to her to determine what her intent was for the model run?  If it was to run one layer, please make sure she understands that for one layer, she should not manually add it, this will be taken care of by the RAPID export if the information was correctly entered prior to running the export.Note that this is only an issue when the same layer is added twice.  I've opened a support ticket with AIR and will be adding checks to ensure users will not be able to submit an analysis when there are duplicate layers. Additional checks will also be done on the results to ensure they balance.  These changes will be included in Friday's release.Thank you,Julie

__label__Auto ​The AUTO is composite rated and in my rating worksheets it shows that the hired auto premium should be about $600.  But in RST it shows Hired auto premium at $4,100.  Can you see why this is so?  Or if this is an error?  It is far higher than I believe it should be. 
__label__Package-Property Per agent's request on endorsement.  A location was added and generated an additional premium of $76, however, there is a credit of $44.  Could it be since the endorsement is out of sequence it recalculated?  
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Good afternoon, One of our UT's, Mary Schorn, has found what could be an unintentional side effect of this update. In most cases, these policies are eligible for Fast Track.  In some cases, changing the company code results in the premium on the renewal jumping by double digit percentages.  This means that the UT will either have to use max debits to be able to get the premium where it needs to be or the increase on the policy will be much higher than the 0% increase that we have been directed to get. Example from Mary: Account # 3006348598.  The CNP rolled over in CC; expiring was in NF.  Capping mod of .586 is included on the policy as well as the .870 IRPM which was on the expiring.  Rate attainment is showing in UWS as +17.6% for the CNP.  Fast Track calls for Flat on CNP type policies.  How will this change impact our Fast Track process as far as pricing these renewals? I didn't know if the effects of this change on the Fast Track process were discussed when this decision was made or not.  However, any direction you can give us on the pricing of the CNP renewals effected by this change would be greatly appreciated.

__label__Package-Property ​Good afternoon – We have an interesting scenario on this account.  The insured has a new location that is still on a builders risk but has a partial certificate of occupancy.  The new location is a high rise condo building so they have a model unit within the building to show potential customers. Our insured has a contract with an interior decorator.  The interior decorator is renting furniture to furnish the model unit but they are requiring our insured to insure the furniture.  The total value of the furniture is 1m.  I initially thought this could be covered under property at an unspecified location but given that the interior decorator is the one renting the furniture I wasn't sure if this would apply.  Can you please review and provide your thoughts / what questions you have?

__label__Workers-Comp ​Jeff had specific questions about the reason Terrorism rates were so high in DC
__label__Not-LOB-Specific ​Chris,From a governance standpoint a multi-year policy should follow the same general procedure as a one year policy. Operationally though there may need to be other considerations – The Field Resource center (FRC) provides detailed procedures for WWO/UT/UW - but I don't know if they would cover all of the systems/processes that Home Foreign uses?  We could certainly discuss between Sales & Distribution and the FRC if we need to refine the governance document or develop operational resources to address unique aspects.  Please let me know if that would be helpful. I could envision differences if you require any application during that period (since we require the new agent to submit a full application in some circumstances) Billing will be different – on page 9 there are sample letters to send to billing and there will be different impacts potentially for multi-year policies (and I believe these letters are in ECF) I assume you process the entire 3 years as one term and recognize the written premium for the entire term when processed.  There are two options; cancel rewrite or the new agency is effective on renewal.  A cancel/rewrite would not necessarily work well given that the earlier part of the term would have been under the original agent.they would be asked to return the commissions they received – although you could get this written off but we would also want to be sure to adjust the commission for the new agent in that case so we don't pay double on the same risk – that would have to be adjusted in the UW system) Unfortunately our Underwriting systems do not support mid-year changes to the producer.  EPC has a spot to capture the BOR (new agent and date) and will change the producer on renewal automatically (which is more than in some UW systems) but the current term will continue to show up under the existing agency and not the new agency. Underwriting does take some other steps to send a copy of the policy to the new producer and those types of steps could be described best by the FRC This is the governance document – probably what you were reviewing.  I know there are quite a few other documents on the resource library but unfortunately I am not sure where to direct you because they are maintained by Underwriting.  The FRC should be able to direct you if there is an existing job aide to address this.http://refdocs.cna.com/WorkplaceXT/getContent?objectStoreName=kbos&id=release&objectType=document&vsId={30B58257-0900-C0D7-BC42-740259415DC4} Anna Duckmann

__label__Auto ​Hello,JoyGA Holdings, otherwise known as Tyler Perry Studios, is a renewal of ours covering the movie production studio of Tyler Perry in Atlanta, GA.  This account has a unique auto exposure as the vast majority of scheduled vehicles are prop vehicles for filming purposes.  These prop vehicles have been classed as Farm Vehicles as the vehicles are used as props and never leave the studio, which is a campus style studio located on an ex-military base in Atlanta.  While the vehicles never leave the studio premises and are typically stationary props, they are occasionally used in slow speeds for filming.I have been advised that the Farm Vehicle classification is not supported in EPC which is an issue as this generates a 50% increase in premium.  With the account out to market this year, we won't be able to retain the account with an unwarranted rate increase of this nature.Do you have any advice on a classification that will get us back to the expiring pricing without drastically decreasing company placement + schedule credits?

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Good Afternoon, Per the account named above we generated short term policies as an extension for the dates of 3/3/18-5/3/18 as the insured is restructuring and required a new effective date. The short term policies were to be generated and immediately issued however since we were in receipt of the renewal exposures they were mistakenly added to the short term program. In order to correct this issue we wanted to amend the short term (3/3/18-5/3/18)  to an annual term of (5/3/18-5/3/19) rather than issuing the short term with the incorrect exposures for (3/3/18-5/13/18) however we were instructed that EPC would recognize a lapse in coverage and therefore the annual term wouldn't generate. Our proposed workaround: issue the short term for 3/3/18-5/3/18roll renewal term from 5/3/18-5/13/19once renewal term is quoted, cancel/ rewrite the short term Per the above bullet points, is this process feasible? Can we issue the short-term, generate the annual renewal quote and then go back and cancel/rewrite the already issued short term policy? Please advise ASAP

__label__Workers-Comp ​Scott needed help entering emods on the WC policy
__label__Package-Property ​Field Resource Team – I believe what we have here has something to do with OOS endorsement processing.  There was an endorsement processed on 2/14/2018 with an effective date of 01/24/2018 which generated a return premium of $61.72  Then we processed an endorsement on 5/8/18 with an effective date of 01/10/18.  This created the OOS.  However, the 1/10/2018 effective date endorsement should have only shown a return of less than $1.00 (.85 to be exact.  However, the insured is receiving a return premium of $1,225 and the agent wants to know why.  Would someone please look at this one and advise why there is such a large return premium shown so I can explain it to the agent.  It wasn't our intent to return that much premium for the 1/10/18 endorsement. Thank you for your assistance.

__label__Package-General-Liability We have an account we've written for a number of years.  With approval we've removed the EIFS (CNA74892xx) and Residential (CNA74862xx) exclusions in the past.  However the 2017 / 2018 GL policy was issued with both of these endorsements by mistake.  The agent has asked us to delete as in the past (and as on the 2018/2019 renewal).  I believe they might show as deleted in our internal system, but we are not able to provide any endorsements or printout showing this to the agent.  I believe it has something to do with having to surpass the endorsements at issuance and not being able to actually delete them.  How do we put something on the 2017/2018 policy to show these forms don't apply?  The agent is concerned with a potential claim scenario down the road. Thank you,rob

Since NCCI no longer recognized Anniversary Rate Dating, I believe the answer is NO, but I'd like to confirm so we can be as accurate as possible in our messaging to the agent/insured. Thanks,

It is not licensed for road use, and has minimal radius of operations. A few questions:Confirming BI/PD resulting from the vehicle would be considered under the GL coverageDo we need to schedule this on the auto policy, or would it be considered personal property as long as it remains on the premises? Perhaps on the inland marine?If this is picked up on the property policy, would there be a way to assign a deductible just to this vehicle? They are considering binding a $10K AOP deductible, where this vehicle is worth $7200 Please include Ryan Barnett on any responses, or if you need any additional information.

The renewal is upcoming on 3/29 and the Umbrella policy (#6015889519) was previously a 9/4 effective date.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Owie got a request back from WWO stating that a number of FEIN's were identical on the policy and all four entities have the same number. 
__label__Package-General-Liability Question for you. We have an insured that is moving to a fee basis with the agent and as a result the account is moving to net of commission. RST is reflecting this as a rate decrease which technically it is. However if you adjusted the expiring premium to net of commission rates and compared those to the renewal pricing which is net then there's very little rate change. That said do you know if RST rate changes get overridden in these situations to reflect the actual rate change on a net vs. net basis?

__label__Package-Property Please let me know if this is something that warrants your help and attention:The 2017 renewal of Arrow Senior Living (account #3019907499) was issued with incorrect commission, except for the BUA policy, which was issued correctly.  Before the commission error was identified on the other 3 lines of business and correction/reissue initiated, additional endorsement transactions had been submitted for the above noted property policy.  The sequence of events thereafter created an increasing state of confusion with respect to billing.  Now, 120 days ahead of renewal, the situation remains problematic.  Coordination is taking up too much time from the underwriter and underwriting technician.  They asked me to find a solution.Billing and Collections threatened to cancel, but the agency needs correct information in order to bill the client correctly and pay CNA.  It appears that the best recourse would be to completely cancel the revised PMT policy, hold any additional pending endorsements, and reissue the policy from scratch.  The endorsements would then follow when the sequence could be guided correctly, and the outcome should be more accurate because the transactions would be done with the right commission and in the right order.I would be happy to forward additional details if this problem is within your authority and expertise to resolve.  Please advise.

__label__Package-Property ​Hi I notice this message popping up constantly while I am modeling – it this an error?
__label__Auto Mike and Frank, engaging both of you for help with this question. I will be on a plane in the morning to Albuquerque.  Please let us know your opinion.  Thanks/////Chris & Kevin,I just spoke to Sarah on a situation with UTI and they are looking for coverage guidance in advance of an 11 am conference call tomorrow (Wednesday)UTI is having their logo on a truck in a race on April 6th.  I'm not sure the location/series of the race.  It doesn't look like the NASCAR Truck series is active on that date.This is not a paid sponsorship.  A group is offering to put their logo on.They do not have ownership in the truck or racing team.They do not have financial interest in the race.Auto policies have a racing exclusion – although I'm not sure the commercial auto policy would come into play as it doesn't sound like we could bridge to this truck being a covered auto.The GL has an Aircraft, Auto or Watercraft Exclusion for BI/ PD.  It looks like this focuses on arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any aircraft, auto or watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any Insured.Given the lack of ownership/interest by UTI in the truck, team, race I again I'm not sure how this would impact.There is an exclusion for the use of mobile equipment as it pertains to BI/PD while in practice for, or while being prepared for, any prearranged racing, speed, demolition, or stunting activity.Mobile Equipment definition extends to Vehicles maintained primarily for purposes other than the transportation of persons or cargo.I think that could be the potential area of concern. This would pertain to vicarious liability as they are only having their logo on the vehicle.Is this something we can address either by endorsement or the insured could potentially address through the use of a contract?

Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number (EIN) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. A FEIN Number is registered for each named insured. Two named insured cannot share the same FEIN. •           Registered Unemployment number - ME,MN,NY,RI,UT.  HI requires a DOL# and NJ requires a NJTIN •           Class code, payroll. •           The information will only be fed to the state the Name is linked to on the policy. Each Named insured and FEIN, listed on the policy, must be linked to the state location or locations where it is registered to file proof of coverage. A name can be linked to multiple state locations. This information must match what the insured  registered with the State Labor Bureau and WC bureau or it will be rejected.  Jennifer ReisPremium Audit - Bureau Reporting Team CNA Worldwide Operations1-877-574-0540 x 7566 (Toll free)407-804-7566 (Direct Line)

__label__Package-Property ​Hi Karen, I apologize for the delay, but this is the account we discussed a couple weeks ago where I need assistance going through the schedule to shore up the locations.  We need to go back to the renewal effective date of 1/1/18 and also shore up with any additional location additions or deletions that may have come in subsequent to the schedule.  A concern my UT raised is the fact that the blanket limit in a communication from the agent is off from the actual SOV.  We have that to contend with as well.  Agent communicated blanket limit @ 282,904,000 (SOV attached to 2/21/18 communication)Insured Renewal @ 290,014,000SOV @ 282,848,000 (SOV attached to 11/11/17 communication as part of the attached) Once we have someone conduct a preliminary review, it might be a good idea to have a quick call to iron out any initial questions.  My objective is to understand which locations are not included on the policy but are referenced in the SOV and vice versa, in addition to understanding the gap in the blanket limit.  We will need to do the same for the auto lob, but I will include instructions under a separate cover. Thank you!

To my understanding, if a policy develops a credibility factor of >.03 the schedule rating applies, otherwise a max credit/debit of +/-15% would apply in eligible states. However, does that lead to a change in the range of the individual risk characteristics, or do they stay the same?

__label__Package-General-Liability I have a question.  If we are using EPC to set up 30 or 60 day diaries for us to follow up on, is there any way in EPC for us to set it so we get an alert (similar to what we get when something is assigned to us) when the due date for the follow up comes up?  It is already assigned to us so we would not get that alert, but I do not see a way under preferences for us to get notifications when our diaries come up.  This is something that would be incredibly helpful going forward as more lines of business are added to EPC and we set more diaries there for follow ups. Thanks.
__label__Workers-Comp ​Ernst, Any leeway that could be made here? I understand and to some extent agree with her in this regard. Even if the agent knows of the need to turn in the exclusion form if the insured doesn't and it's missed faulting the insured under these circumstances is a bit inequitable. Just wanted to see once more if any exception could be made on this case as the insured had no idea an exclusion form was needed since no notice was received back in November of  2016. Best,

__label__Auto Mike,Currently, when an auto policy has been with CNA for the last 4 years – all of the losses are able to be automatically pulled from RST into EPC without a manual data transfer.In situations where an auto policy has not been with CNA for the last 4 years, there will be losses that are in RST that will require manual transfer to EPC.The question was raised regarding who should be responsible for transferring these losses to EPC.The process appears to be that the UT must provide the information to WWO so that the losses can be updated in EPC.What exactly does the UT need to do in order to get the PSR to update these auto losses and at what point in the workflow would the UT need to provide this direction?The UT already annotated the loss history once when doing the new business set up for the PSR to key the information into RST under Loss Analysis/Detailed Prior Carrier/Emod.  I would think that it would make sense for the losses to be updated by the PSR into EPC during the roll over process.The losses are right there in RST – why not just have the PSR update them as part of their standard work without having to engage the UT at all?Can you track down the answer to these questions for me and email the response?

__label__Package-Property ​Hi Amy, This is in reference to the project we had Toby work on for us.  It looks like the Ordinary Payroll endorsement is not printing out the 90 days although the information appears to have been entered into TAP.  The agent is requesting that it be included.  Can you please have Toby or another PSR review to ensure the change was processed accurately (no reason to believe it had not been) and open an incident with the help desk to be escalated?   FRC/Karen, this is a situation where we need to get the output out to the agent today if at all possible.  As we wait for a fix, can we manual have the 90 days added to the endorsement on both referenced policies?  Thank you!
__label__Workers-Comp Hello,Can you please help me with the agent's questions below? Thank yoU!​I am really confused and hope that you can help.  We just received the attached renewal that was issued on 8/11/2018.  The policy dates are 12/30/2016-12/30/2017.  I don't know why this was sent now – and it isn't even the same premium of the original renewal that we received back in 2016.    Help.  Please 😊

__label__Auto I am starting preparation of this 8/1 renewal which is in EPC.The first item I found is that the rater/tech notes were not completed for the auto section of the policy.  It has been rated because the experience mod has been done and a schedule mod is showing in the Modifiers section of the policy.  None of this information has been transferred into the rater/tech notes document.The second item I found has to do with the Supplemental Applications.  This policy has vehicles garaged in Ohio and Texas.  When I checked the Supplemental Application tab, both states are listed but both are marked received.  Ohio does not have a UM/UIM app that has to be completed so it technically should not come up on the screen at all or should come up with an N/A in the field. I have reviewed the documents on the prior policies and the TX form has not been received so I am not sure why it was marked received.
__label__Package-Property I had previously been advised that the CNA proprietary forms for PMT contain a 60 day notice of cancelation.  Maryland also requires a 60 day notice of cancelation.I have been advised by rating that for policies in EPC: CUE, WC, BUA the PSR's will follow the MD state minimum rule for the 60 days NOCFor package policies there is blanket form that is available: CNA75014 but the wording on the form is 30 days' notice and cannot be changed.  Does this mean that we cannot use blanket 3rd party NOC in MD?  Or is there another form to use in MD to provide the blanket wording?

__label__Package-General-Liability ​According to the Commercial Canadian Locations – Exposure level guidelines (published June of 2017), the following applies:  In cases where our insured is doing work in Canada for an extended period of time and has related Canadian 'payroll' or 'sales', and the agent/broker has requested those job sites or locations be scheduled on our policy, those Canadian job sites can only be added by applying the same rates to the Canadian exposure as the insured's domiciled rates.  Policy Holder Notice – Countrywide – Location in Canada CNA82097XX (04-15) must be added to the policy. In addition, the Underwriter is also required to alert the agent and broker to the insured's responsibility to pay the Canadian Tax associated with this premium charge.  The required form letter is loaded in UWS under:  Correspondence/Form Letters/Canadian Premium Tax Alert.   Since we are now getting all of our templates out of DMF (and this one is no longer in UWS), I cannot locate the template for this notice. This is what it shows when I do the search for Canadian Premium Tax Alert, which takes me to the excel document that has the UWS templates list and the corresponding DMF template number and name.  This form is not listed anywhere.  Can you shed light as to where I can find this form?  I need it for an account that is renewing shortly. 
__label__Monoline ​Can we still issue PST with the premium $2,500 even though it's a short term? We already bound the quote with premium of $2,500.  We told the agent that we didn't prorate the premium for the PST policy.  Please advise.  Thank you

It is currently inferring for every WC policy in which the form is approved.  It notes that the form should only apply to those policies that are experience rated.All of the WC policies for the captive program have an experience mod promulgated by NCCI and/or State Bureaus. Should this form be added back to all policies?

__label__Package-Property ​Good morning! Your next assignment should you take it is help me explain the billing to the agent as I simply don't have time to track this back. Here's the back story.  We issued this policy for a 1/1/18 effective date and in FEBRUARY were supposed to cancel and rewrite the policy with underwriting company and IRPM changes to the property.   The UT handling it forgot to do it in February; and again in March when she was reminded; but, in April it was processed.   So first we have a cancel and rewrite of the base policy. Then as of 1/1/18 we added a new location.  1216 E. 6th Street.3/1/2018 we added the new building at 1300 East 6th Street.4/23/18 we deleted 101 S. Spring Street and moved the bpp and bi/ee and added it to 1300 East 6th Street, Little Rock, AR. Can you go through the billing summary and make sure it is correct.  Agent wants to be able to explain it to the insured.

__label__Package-General-Liability   FRC,  Can you research the below and advise how we should go about this?  ThanksI need help in figuring out who to go to for help on this account. This was a November renewal that we requested the Subsidence and Residential Exclusion to be suppressed. In my issuance instructions, you can see where I made the request but there are no WWO comments next to it which normally means they didn't address it. The forms printed with the renewal (CNA74682XX & CNA74862XX). The agent sent an endorsement on 04/16/2018 requesting they be removed and something was processed but it only shows a form was deleted with no other details.Before I submit an IT ticket, I need to confirm whether the policy was issued correctly to start with and that the endorsement they processed was not suppress print of the two forms. If the forms where in fact suppressed at issuance, than we need to submit a ticket because that is a TAP error. If not, we can go back to the agent advise that the endorsement they sent in effectively removed the two exclusions.I hope that makes sense, let me know if you have any questions.
__label__Workers-Comp Can you advise on the below question? I don't want to answer incorrectly and set a precedent.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Got a quick WC question for you, if the insured has an employee who lives in CA but travels back and forth to TX (currently gets paid out of a CA entity) but they will be moving his payroll to get paid out of a Texas entity, which comp policy picks him up?

__label__Workers-Comp ​Good morning!  My underwriter has asked me to do a cancel/rewrite but I'm wondering if I can do a correction /reissue in this situation. Effective Date:  12/1/2017 – 12/1/2018We issued the policy  with an E-Mod.We received a Crit from State of WI informing us we can't use the e-mod (belongs to ADP, not EKJ).At the orders of the CNA Crit Team we issued an Endorsement removing the e-mod; resulted in a $12k AP.Insured upset and UW asked me to cancel/rewrite to rework the credits to bring it back down to the original intended premium.The only Endorsement on the policy is the one created because of the WI Crit ($12k AP). Can I do a Correction / Reissue? I started a Correction/Reissue effective 12/1/2017 and the e-mod is not showing in EPC.  What happens to the Endorsement?  I know when you cancel/rewrite you have to also re-do the Endorsements.  Do I need to reverse the Endorsement?

Per your instructions for the WC, the policy should be issued on 15% monthly reporting. We are able to issue the policy on monthly reporting, but this can only be updated in the field for audit frequency and is not an actual pay plan, so unfortunately there is no way to issue the policy with 15% down and monthly reporting. The only way to issue the policy on the monthly reporting is to issue with a pay plan of agency prepay (you can then make subsequent arrangements with billing after issuance if installments are needed). Please confirm if OK to issue accordingly on the monthly reporting. If not, please provide alternate pay plan to use for issuance, and we will update accordingly and remove the monthly reporting.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Could someone from Field Resource Center please reach out the UW/UT to provide further clarification. We have advised that we are not allowed to issue a WC policy that has MO exposure if the agency is not licensed to write insurance in MO (I'm not sure how the expiring term was issued without that being caught) and that the information in UWS shows that they are not licensed in the state of MO, but they are requesting we issue the policy without proof of MO compliance being met. We have already provided the job aid from Resource Library and advised that we are not allowed to proceed with issuance if the information we have shows that the agent is not licensed in the state of MO, but we are still receiving pushback. (Apparently it wasn't caught the prior term when the policy was issued, but I know the fines have gotten very steep, and we've been advised that under no circumstances should we be issuing policies like this in the future until proof of MO compliance is obtained) 
__label__Package-General-Liability HelloWe have an insurance company and a mandatory exclusion is the Inspection, Appraisal and Survey Companies Exclusion ( copy attached)The agent has come back with the following remark.Can we discuss Inspection exclusion.Lets say they have someone go out and do an inspection of a property while that inspection company has insurance I would also expect our policy to provide protection if someone was injured.   If the insured has the premises inspected and someone is injured while the inspection is being performed. I.E someone trips over a tool box would the attached exclusion come into play and there would be no coverage for such an instance. Would the BI be part of the rendering or failure to render the professional servicesThis insurance does not apply to bodily injury, property damage or personal and advertising injury for which the Insured may be held liable because of the rendering of or failure to render professional services.As used herein, professional services means claim, investigation, adjustment, engineering, inspection, appraisal, survey or audit services.
__label__Auto ​Hi Andrew, I believe we discussed this account a little bit over IM but wanted to inquire on the rate change on this one.  I can understand it somewhat due the following - Auto last year was presumably Rule 15ed by the prior underwriter last year with a 2.6 other mod.  There is no documentation in file for the Rule 15 and in review this year on the renewal it does not qualify for Rule 15.  I did note however that the classification of these vehicles was somewhat incorrect as the insured's vehicles delivery range is the entirety of California.  Insured regularly makes trips from Fresno to Los Angeles which is over 250 miles so I amended the classification for all vehicles above a medium truck to zone rated and priced accordingly.  Proposed Auto Premium by Profile is the following - PPT $2,779Light Truck $2,418Medium Truck $7,281Heavy Truck - $9,093XHT - $11,583Trailer - $1,077HTT - $9,506XHTT - $12,973 Last Years Auto Premium by Profile was the following - PPT $3,591 Light Truck $3,625 Medium Truck $6,728 Heavy Truck - $7,866 Trailer - $424 XHTT - $13,498 As you can see the rates have stayed fairly consistent from a fleet profile perspective and for the most part we are actually collecting far more premium than prior due to the zone rating of the larger trucks.  I would like to see if consideration can be made from a rate perspective to manually correct the rate change in RST due to the fact that 1. The Insured does not qualify for Rule 15, nor did it qualify last year (nor is there documentation in the file for it). 2. The insured's operations and zone of delivery has not changed year over year so there is no material change in operations that would have caused them to NOT be zone-rated last year. Please let me know if you have any questions.

__label__Package-Property ​Hello, I'm working on this new business account. The insured is an engineering firm. The property consists of office exposure only but tiering at a tier V in manual company. RST is showing a technical rate of 0.14, which seems very high. This is resulting in a quote to technical ratio of 0.40, which is out of branch authority. This account was originally rated incorrectly as Service NOC occupancy (HG-3). I changed the occupancy to Professional Services - Office NOC (HG-1). Changing the hazard grade/occupancy didn't seem to help the rating/tiering. This seems incorrect to me. Please advise how this is calculating such a high technical rate. Thank you!

__label__Package-Property ​Perhaps you could help me with this.  The insured has several suites in the same building, though they do not own the building.  Based on my reading of the policy, it seems to me that barring any intentional actions to harm their own equipment, if the equipment were to be damaged moving between suites, there isn't any particular exclusion or wording that would preclude coverage.  However, I would like some feedback on this because if there is an issue, I would like to find an endorsement to address since that is a concern for this account.

__label__Auto Hello,I'm seeking guidance on how to answer the agent's auto question below, which I've highlighted in Yellow. I want to be very careful with my wording and interpretation of coverage which is why I'm seeking guidance.My thoughts on the answer is below, but please let me know your thoughts on how to craft the wording. Thanks!Generally I'm thinking that the ICs would be covered only if the insured gave the IC permission to drive a covered auto the named insured owns, hires or borrows. The IC wouldnot be covered under non-owned coverage, where the IC is driving their own vehicle on company business for Clover Health Investments, since they wouldn't qualify under the Who is An Insured section of the auto policy (I'm not 100% on this – please confirm).  Clover Health Associates is not a Named Insured so any IC driving on their behalf would not be covered.1. For an independent contractor who is contracted under Clover Health LLC - are these individuals covered for both bodily and auto damage if they have an accident while they are performing services for Clover? 2. For independent contractor physicians who are contracted under Clover Health Associates - are these individuals covered for both bodily and auto damage if they have an accident while they are performing services for Clover? Is CHA covered as an additional insured on the auto policy?

__label__Package-Property ​I don't believe I should be showing the -16.6% rate change. The only change in the rating was actually a reduction in coverage in which we are now excluding installation from the PMT as that coverage is now being provided per a Inland Marine Coverage Part.

Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number (EIN) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. A FEIN Number is registered for each named insured. Two named insured cannot share the same FEIN. •           Registered Unemployment number - ME,MN,NY,RI,UT.  HI requires a DOL# and NJ requires a NJTIN •           Class code, payroll. •           The information will only be fed to the state the Name is linked to on the policy. Each Named insured and FEIN, listed on the policy, must be linked to the state location or locations where it is registered to file proof of coverage. A name can be linked to multiple state locations. This information must match what the insured  registered with the State Labor Bureau and WC bureau or it will be rejected.

__label__Umbrella The Umbrella rate is showing as a -40%. The change, I believe, is coming directly from the increased sales on the GL line (up 800k over expiring). The premium we are using is a minimum premium. I added maximum debits to the policy and that did nothing to change the price. How can -40% be accurate when I added at least 50% debit? Also, when I did add the debits, the premium did not increase at all and RST still showed a -40% rate. Any insight you could provide would be appreciated. ​

__label__Package-Property ​Hi FRC, I met with one an agent today who is currently doing a study for the city of Vernon regarding property protection class. The city is thinking on investing money to increase the protection classes on certain zip codes; an incentive would be to save business owners money on insurance. They asked if I had any info on this: Would the premium savings outweigh the cost it takes to increase the protection class?Would improving the protection class from a 3 to a 1 make a difference?Where does it start making sense to invest money on improving the protection class? When a location is PC 8? 10? Any info on this is greatly appreciated.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Hello I am unable to view submission EPC. Please assist.
__label__Workers-Comp The FSR department/ WWO / Crit team does not file WC policies to provide proof of coverage or verify filing for proof of coverage. If you receive this type of fine letter from an agent/insured please review the policy, link the names to the proper states, correct any incorrect Name, FEIN or UI # and issue the endorsement to file the proof of coverage with the state. Please see the attached Proof of Coverage document.All Workers Compensation files electronically for all carriers through WCPOLS by issuance of the policy or endorsement.NCCI and the states will only accept the electronic filing which is produced by issuance of the policy or endorsement.The electronic feed goes out in a batch to NCCI and the states in the evening. NCCI accepts or rejects the policy the next day.Independent  states have different schedules on when they accept the information usually 3-7 business days. What feeds electronically for proof of coverage?  If any of these items are incorrect on the issued policy the insured is uninsured. •           Name and legal entity –Must be an employing entity in the USA. •           Registered FEIN –Electronic filing for proof of coverage is by the FEIN number. Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number (EIN) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. A FEIN Number is registered for each named insured. Two named insured cannot share the same FEIN. •           Registered Unemployment number - ME,MN,NY,RI,UT.  HI requires a DOL# and NJ requires a NJTIN •           Class code, payroll. •           The information will only be fed to the state the Name is linked to on the policy. Each Named insured and FEIN, listed on the policy, must be linked to the state location or locations where it is registered to file proof of coverage. A name can be linked to multiple state locations. This information must match what the insured  registered with the State Labor Bureau and WC bureau or it will be rejected. Remember dates matter.Always change mailing  address at inceptionAlways add a location at inception or the date the insured hired its first employee in a state.Once the state accepts the date of coverage you cannot change to an earlier date without flat cancel and new policy number as new business for New York

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Good afternoon, I have a suggestion to greatly improve the process of closing out New Business policies within EPC. When a policy (or policies) within a new business submission is to be closed out of EPC (either declined or not taken), it would be significantly easier and more efficient to be able to close out the policies within the account at the same time - regardless of whether or not the policies are EPC or non-EPC.  Currently, every individual EPC policy has to be closed out separately… locked, then close options chosen, then declined with a reason.  This is a multiple-step process for each EPC policy.  If there are multiple EPC policies, this step is required each time. Then, in order to close outnon-EPC policies, a different process is required.  Fortunately,non-EPC policies can be closed at the same time, for the same reason.  Unfortunately, each individualEPC policy has to be closed separately. To close out one account, all EPC and non-EPC policies require separate and distinct processes.  This is a very inefficient process and can be time-consuming.  We need the ease and ability to close out all policies (as needed) with one single process - - just as it is accomplished withnon-EPC policies. Let me know if you have any questions.  I'll be happy to share my monitor to show the multi-step processes. Thank you very much.

__label__Package-Property ​Good Morning,  To summarize, we are up to end't #104-108  processed on this policy and the policy effective date is 11/1/17-18.The agents request is that the Loss Payee & Mortgagee read as Clause B/CLoc's  3 & 9 were initially issued with an entities listed as clause B AND B/C. Loc's  26 &  28 the entity were only listed as clause B/CAn end't was complete on 3/28 amending entities, deleted Loc's  3 & 9 clause B (leaving the B/C only) and did not amend Loc's  26 &  28.Another end't was completed on 6/11 amending these entities Loc's  3 & 9 to clause B- the assumption being the previous end't did not suffice.Another end't was completed on 6/21, entities for Loc's 3 & 9 are added as 'B/C'=Mortgagee(in TAP) &  Loc's 26 & 28 as 'B'= Lenders Loss Payee(in TAP(shows on endt as Loss Payee &Mortgagee Clause Applicable: B/C and Loss Payee &Mortgagee Clause Applicable: B)) and the extended names were added to the Amendment to Schedule of  Loss Payees or Mortgagees CNA76799 in section C,  per the Skype discussion with the UT. The entities were listed as both this time to be sure the agent/insured sees them how they want them seen. [my guess to the issue is that the end't shows the changes, not the schedule of Loss Payees/Mortgagees as it currently would reads] per the UT: Nancy,  I guess the loss payee is not willing to accept the form as issued.  They are wanting all changes on 1 endorsement so the underwriter and I were wondering if we could delete and read in  tap so the listing prints out exactly as requested by the agency/ Loss Payee?  Kerrie BrashThere are currently 10 OOS Endt's awaiting process.Pretty much each OOS ends up in Open Incident status, due to TAP's inability to ReProcess the OOS transactions timely. I hope this helps condense the email trail below.Any advice on how to accommodate the request would be appreciated.

__label__Monoline ​Good Morning, Would you be able to elaborate on the difference between Operational Testing Coverage and Electrical Disturbance Testing? I believe that Operational Testing is intended for use in relationship to work at jobsites (included on the installation floater) – so this is covering equipment breakdown when off premises (when insured is performing testing on said equipment as part of their contractor work). In contrast, I think that Electrical Disturbance Testing is for EDP – or property that is on the insured's own premises and not in connection to insured's own contracting work. However – as I cannot find the word Electrical Disturbance Testing listed specifically in our forms (only finding Electrical Disturbance), so not sure if these are the same. Appreciate your help!Spencer

__label__Umbrella ​ Afternoon:   I have a question that came from an agent.  An endorsement was sent in to add 30 NOC on the umbrella.  The  endorsement team sent an email ( in red) saying the umbrella follows the GL. (which I understand in theory).  My question: If there is an entity            on the GL policy that has a 30 DNOC  what would trigger the umbrella policy to notify the same entity of NOC if the policy was cancelled Per the attached request: Just to make you aware, as a general rule we do not add a Notice of Cancellation to our Umbrella policy when you have your Package/GL policy with us because it follows that policy. That policy already includes the coverage so there is no need to add them to the Umbrella. Therefore you will not receive an endorsement on this request. Should you have any questions please feel free to reach out directly to your Underwriter. (fyi – your CUE policy has a 60 day Notice of Cancellation on it)

__label__Package-Property ​Hi FRC, Are we able to delete/remove the extra expense additional coverage for one specific location? The below mentioned location did not have any kind of time element coverage scheduled on the policy. I'm not seeing a way in TAP to exclude coverage by a location.. rather the only option is to exclude the coverage from the policy completely. My initial thought after seeing this was that we could possibly change the other BI coverage on the policy Business Income W/ Extra Expense, and then exclude the policy level extra expense coverage. Any help on this would be appreciated.

There is not anything we can manually file.In reviewing the letter and the policy, the FEIN on your policy for WEDBUSH SECURITIES, INC. does not match what NY has per the letter ending in (***5390) and the policy has the UI number for WEDBUSH SECURITIES, INC. on all names linked to NY.  The state of NY has a default UI and it should be used if the UI number is not known at the time of issuance.  To correct, you will need to process an endorsement effective inception to correct the FEIN's on the policy and provide the correct NY UI number for each named insured linked to NY. It appears the FEIN for WEDBUSH SECURITIES, INC. is listed on the policy for WEDBUSH, INC. but you will want to confirm with the agent/insured.

__label__Workers-Comp ​We have this renewal account that the agent wants to go back to 10/1/2017 and put the WC network credit on, can we do that?
__label__Workers-Comp ​Hi Kerri, The FSR department does not file WC policies to provide proof of coverage, WC filing is based on policy issuance. When you receive a notice from the state please review your policy for the Name, FEIN, any state IDs required and that it is linked to the state location. While this name is on the policy, it is not linked to the state of NY on the locations screen with the NY unemployment number. Proof of coverage is only sent to the states the named insured is linked to on the locations screen in EPC. You will need to request an endorsement effective inception to link the name to the NY location with the NY UI number to file proof of coverage with NY. In addition, the 2 names that are linked to NY do not have the correct NY unemployment number, they have the default.  An activity was generated in EPC and assigned to you for the Unemployment Number/ Tax ID that was missing.   Unemployment Number/ Tax ID is required to avoid penalties for ME,MN,NY,RI,UT.  HI requires a DOL# and NJ requires a NJTIN.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello Andrea, The FSR department does not file WC policies to provide proof of coverage or verify filing for proof of coverage. If you receive this type of fine letter from an agent/insured please review the policy, link the names to the proper states, correct any incorrect Name, FEIN or UI # and issue the endorsement to file the proof of coverage with the state. Please see the attached Proof of Coverage document. All Workers Compensation files electronically for all carriers through WCPOLS by issuance of the policy or endorsement.NCCI and the states will only accept the electronic filing which is produced by issuance of the policy or endorsement.The electronic feed goes out in a batch to NCCI and the states in the evening. NCCI accepts or rejects the policy the next day.Independent  states have different schedules on when they accept the information usually 3-7 business days.  What feeds electronically for proof of coverage?  If any of these items are incorrect on the issued policy the insured isuninsured. •           Name and legal entity –Must be an employing entity in the USA. •           Registered FEIN –Electronic filing for proof of coverage is by the FEIN number. Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number (EIN) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. A FEIN Number is registered for each named insured. Two named insured cannot share the same FEIN. •           Registered Unemployment number - ME,MN,NY,RI,UT.  HI requires a DOL# and NJ requires a NJTIN •           Class code, payroll. •           The information will only be fed to the state the Name is linked to on the policy. Each Named insured and FEIN, listed on the policy, must be linked to the state location or locations where it is registered to file proof of coverage. A name can be linked to multiple state locations. This information must match what the insured  registered with the State Labor Bureau and WC bureau or it will be rejected.

__label__Auto Our schedule of coverages page on the policy indicates see endorsement for Uninsured Motorist coverage. The Arkansas UM form CA 208 is blank for limit with the usual Information required to complete the schedule, if not shown above, will be shown in the declarations.  I can't spot a limit for Arkansas anywhere on the policy.Form CA 2151 Split Bodily Injury Underinsured Motorist Coverage Limit indicates a BI limit of $500,000.  There is no state indicated on this form.    Arkansas is rated with $500,000/$1,000,000 BI limits for Uninsured Motorist and Underinsured Motorist.  Because I can see the worksheets I think this form applies to Arkansas, but I don't think that is clear.  The agent apparently thinks it applies only to WA. Form CA 20 66  for Arkansas indicates  a separate $25,000 PD limit.The CA 2134 Washington Underinsured Motorist coverage form indicates BI/PD limit of $1,000,000 per accident.  That is also what shows up on our rating worksheets.It is very confusing when we have multiple states on a policy with varied UM limits, and it is worse when our policy doesn't indicate limits.  This is a new agency assignment for me, and I am unfamiliar with the account. Can you help clarify this for me so I can pass on a coherent explanation to Monica?

There is no mention of MO compliance in UWS or DMF. Please provide updated proof of MO compliance being met. I have included the job aid link below, showing that we are not allowed to proceed with issuance until this information has been confirmed.  Our hands are tied as far as issuing the policy with MO on it until MO compliance has been met and we have proof that the agent is licensed to write insurance in the state of MO. If the policy needs to be issued for premium close, and you are not able to obtain the necessary proof in time, we can remove MO from the policy and issue accordingly until it is obtained, at which point MO can be added back on via endorsement. Please advise if you would like us to do that; otherwise, FRC can further assist you regarding the matter of MO proof of compliance if needed. https://refdocs.cna.com/WorkplaceXT/getContent?objectStoreName=kbos&id=release&objectType=document&vsId={101A2557-0900-C2A4-8008-E878C393C3C6}   2.     NOTE:Please be advised that at least one of the states on the policy requiring a specific location address when applicable, is currently listed as non-specific. We will issue the policy using the no specific location verbiage per EPC; if/when any applicable location addresses are provided, the policy can be updated via endorsement accordingly. The non-specific states currently requiring a location address if one applies are:NV & TX. (Please note that employee's home addresses are not considered valid location addresses and would instead use the NSL verbiage.)

__label__Package-General-Liability I received the attached final audit for the 2017-2018 term of the above captioned policy.  To me the calculations do not appear to be correct.  When I take the actual exposure and divide it by 1,000 and multiply it time the rate, I don't come to the same premium figures that are shown on the audit.  For example Code 56916 has an actual exposure of $3,637,950.  If I take that and divide it by $1,000 and multiply it by the rate of $1.688 I get a premium of $6,141 in lieu of $6,180.  I'm I doing something incorrectly?  Please advise.
__label__Auto ​The Auto rate change is showing -22. This is a Hired/Non owned auto policy, the only exposure change is an increase in the number of drivers (25 increased to 89). I increased the scheduled mod from .95 to 1.00. There should not be a negative rate change on this as far as I can tell. Please look into this and let me know why this is calculating as a negative rate.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hi FRC, I would like to have your advice on this situation. There are duplicated WC coverages, with one term of 1/1/18-1/1/19 and the other term of 5/29/18-6/1/19. However, they are with different distributors. Now the current distributor asked to cancel the 1/1/18-1/1/19 term. Problem is, the other term is longer than 12 months. I understand that WC policies can be 1 year and 16 days long, but I believe if it is it longer than a year, there might be issues with experience mod calculation. Can you advise if it will be safe to keep a long term WC policy? At renewal it will be renewed annual. 
__label__Auto OrePac Holding Company BUA 6057343131I have a risk with a larger auto fleet that consists of tractors and trailers.  The policy is composite rated with wording that specifically limits physical damage coverage to units of a certain age.The insured had a loss involving both a tractor and trailer and we applied separate deductibles to each unit.Is there a way of structuring the policy so that only one deductible applies per connected unit?  I want to be able to only have one deductible per occurrence, however, I want to avoid adding any per occurrence wording as I don't want only one deductible applicable if multiple units are affected by one loss (i.e. weather related, hail-type incident).Are we able to have the second paragraph adjusted to wording along the lines of $2,000 DEDUCTIBLE COMPREHENSIVE AND COLLISION COVERAGE FOR HEAVY, EXTRA HEAVY, TRUCK TRACTOR, AND CONNECTED TRUCK TRACTOR WITH TRAILER VEHICLES, to have only one deductible applicable when a connected tractor and trailer unit is involved in the same loss?

So in EPC,  I am in rate status, my experience is not locked and I am on the UWI screen under prior losses.    My issue is that I do not see how to enter the loss info in epc.  Nothing opens up for me to enter loss info. I am sure its user input error (me) but Christina did not know what is wrong either.   Any help you could give me would be appreciated. 3 years of loss history is not being utilized in the dashboard results for policy 6045668665. Update EPC when losses are available or indicate that the risk is loss-free and then Refresh RST.

__label__Auto Hi Mike,I briefly mentioned that I needed your assistance with an Avis related issue but we never really spoke. If you will recall, the AVIS Auto program consists of 3 underlying Auto policies that are Matching Deductible.  These policies are used for different purposes by AVIS.  Briefly:BUA 7001700830 à This is the Financial Responsibility Limits (FRL) policy whereby Avis/Budget provide minimum limits to their rental fleet in 11 US states and USVI and PR.  These are the states/territories that do not allow pure self-insurance so we provide a minimum limits policy for their POC needs.BUA 7001704974 à This is the policy whereby we provide paper for their Executive Autos and Autos leased back to EE's under their Lease Car programs. BUA 2083558793 à This is the policy that Avis/Budget use for certificate purposes.  If a state or municipality requires a certificate of insurance this is the policy that is referenced.  Excluded via the coverage symbol is any Auto covered under the other two policies or any Auto in a jurisdiction in which Avis/Budget is a qualified self-insurer.The forms and wording for these policies were constructed years ago (at least as far back as 2012) and I do not have record of how the manuscripted wording was formulated and approved.  I'm sure that Steve Morrow or even his predecessor had numerous conversations and policy structure/wording but I don't have record of it. I want to make sure that the manuscripted forms we have on these policies dove-tail with the 10/13 CA 0001. I know this is a project but I need to give AOV and Avis a heads up if we need to change any forms significantly. My time-frame for this review is by the end of February.

__label__Umbrella ​Hi Team, Can you advise if booked premium for Monoline Umbrella hits our billing systems to reflect accurately when the next statement or payment schedule generates?  We are trying to get more disciplined about requiring the underlying policies prior to issuing an Umbrella policy; however, this can be challenging as it is reliant upon the underlying carrier issuing their policies in a timely manner.  Concern has been raised about the impact to billing if we hold the issuance until we have the underlying policies in hand.  I would imagine there is little to worry about if booking a policy, which automatically reflects in our financials, impacts billing regardless of whether the policy is issued.  My question would be the same for Direct Bill and Agency Bill. Sincerely,
__label__Package-General-Liability I have a renewal I am working where another agent submitted an application for this same account. It was declined due to prior submission/current account. However, when working it, I see that the pricing screen in UWS is showing the new account numbers for the declined submission as well as the current renewal policy numbers.Just curious why this is?  It makes it a bit more cumbersome to work with multiple policy numbers showing up.  Is there a way to remove those extra numbers on the premium screen?

__label__Umbrella ​I  have a question related to the loss run report in  UWS  
__label__Package-General-Liability ​I'm working on an account (Congruex – 3034861080) and have a question about the additional insured charge.  Congruex is a holding company (PE firm) that purchased several of our insureds and we're rolling together on an account.  So the state of domicile is California, which has a fixed charge of 24% for the unlimited blanket AI.  However, the actual construction entity is located in Georgia and all of their work is in southern states such as Texas.  Charging 24% on the entire GL premium seems too steep when part of the GL premium is developed from a Tech company and part from a construction entity not operating in California.  Do we have any flexibility in how we might charge for this given the unusual situation?
__label__Workers-Comp ​I have an agent who noticed that payroll was not reported to NCCI for the 2016-2017 term and may be causing their Emod to be higher than expected. The account number is 0122574814  and the WC policy # is 6024377329.  The agent is questioning if CNA reported payroll to NCCI for this term. It was written new to CNA during the term that is missing from the Emod worksheet. I have attached the worksheet in question along with the email chain from the agent. Please let me know if this is something you can help me with or if I need to contact NCCI directly to resolve this issue.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Team, good morning.  Happy Friday JQuick GL question for you …If we have a LRO account and during the course of the policy year we add a location, can we apply more or less schedule credits for that individual location we are endorsing on ?So …We have an LRO with an average rate of $25.00 per $1,000 on the GL, based on Sq Ft.    This is NOT composite rated.  I just backed into the average rate using my calculator. Now we add a location after 3 months lets say and I get it rated up in TAP, and the rating pages come back and that location is at a $28 rate.  Not the average $25 above. Again, account GL is NOT composite rated.  Can I apply increased credits as we endorse this new hypothetical location onto the policy to reduce it to $25 ?  From $28?The $25 and $28 are just hypothetical numbers.  I am just using them for example.Thoughts ?

That's the policy term in question. Karen had mentioned there was a comment in the file about premium finance? I need to understand what the genesis of that comment is.  Was this just an error on CNA's part? Was there a reason for the cancellation? When we reinstate and generate a premium, it's going to be a big problem…. Especially when we are in the process of renewing a non-existent policy!----------------------------------------Good Morning,I have Guerguina all the information that I had regarding this situation from a billing perspective. I had asked Guergina to speak with a supervisor in the filing service department since that is where the cancellations of the policy would have been completed.  Some information below on the timeline indicates that a request may have been sent to inquire regarding cancellation and then right after that the policy was cancelled, however I would ask our filing service department if they can review for further details. I have included them on this email.Synopsis from Billing:There was a conversation with the agent March 2017 who indicated that customer was going to cancel the property coverage, however the agent sent in an LPR (which cancels the entire policy) effective 12/31/16.  Policy was cancelled effective that date in March. In July after the cancellation audit was completed the customer was refunded the unearned premium of $74,602.96 In Oct 2017, the policy was reinstated in order to complete the correct transaction of just removing the property coverageOn Oct 17th Guergina had called into the call center regarding this policy and the contact center thought that the full policy was going to be cancelled so they suspended the invoicing for the earned premium that was due on the policy until November.In Nov 2017, the renewal for 2017/2018 was issued and billed along with the earned premium for prior term on the attached invoice as a past due invoice. The customer was also called by our front end callers for past due premium and the attached invoice was emailed to invoices@monclerus.On 11/9/17 Guerguina called to review the account with Robbie Thompson in our contact center. The note indicates conversation on the policy 6045413305 and the open balance. The last sentences stated that she was sending to fsr for what happened so the prop can be cancelled.Right after this invoice was issued policy 6045413305 was cancelled again to 12/31/16 and the renewal was flat cancelled.It appears the inquiring back on 11/9 prompted the cancellation of the policy again.

__label__Package-General-Liability Hello Linda,Per our workflow:CNA is not permitted to issue policies with MO exposure or vehicles on them, unless proof of MO compliance has been obtained and attached in UWS/DMF. Not only does CNA incur hefty fines for this, but the company was required to put a remediation plan in place regarding MO compliance, which includes committing to no longer issuing policies that have MO exposure if the agents do not have licenses to write insurance in the state of MO. It is VITALLY IMPORTANT that as the last line of defense, we in Issuance are verifying that we have proof that we are in compliance of MO state law. We cannot make any exceptions based on Underwriting instruction.If you are processing a policy that requires proof of MO compliance, please check DMF and/or UWS to ensure that documentation is attached showing proof has been met. If the agent does not have an active license (or if there is no documentation regarding MO compliance), we are not allowed to issue the policy until they have an agent that is, and have submitted/attached proof accordingly. (If the policy is a renewal, we do not require updated proof of MO compliance each year unless there are updated apps/agents submitted; you simply need to ensure that we have obtained proof of compliance on a prior term)

__label__Auto Good day. Just an observation on the Create Multiple Versions job aid. On page 1 – OVERVIEW section in the Blue box:The yellow-highlighted line, while true for activities falling under the EDIT POLICY TRANSACTION, would not apply to the Create Multiple Quote Versions.The QUOTE VERSION button is outside of the EDIT POLICY TRANSACTION button.  If you click EDIT POLICY TRANSACTION, the QUOTE VERSION button is not available once within the edit mode.I do realize this BLUE box is standard verbiage on the Job Aids (and is quite helpful), so there is an expectation that you are ready to begin the steps outlined in the job aid.   But in this case, there is an exception. Please let me know if you have any questions. 
__label__Package-General-Liability I sent this account to service to be issued yesterday morning.  I got the attached 3 emails yesterday afternoon.  UWS show the policies are issued and active so I am not sure why I got the above. My agent took it over as a bor which is why there are 9 policies showing and not just the 5 that belong to me.
__label__Package-General-Liability Hi,Our New Mexico underwriter Byrd Horner, has several large accounts that ask for gl rates for specific class codes when bidding large out of state projects.Byrd has been using TAP to dummy up an endorsement and obtain the rate based on the account experience and current company and schedule pricing. As you can imagine this take some time to complete.I'm asking if the FRC could handle these requests if Byrd provided the specific information – state, territory and code? Sometimes these are same day or 1 day turnaround requests. Thanks

__label__Workers-Comp ​Good morning, team.I have two questions regarding some of the policy holds we are currently experiencing: For policy holds that are a result of a pending WC rate change (such as Texas), why are we not using a Pending Rate Change endorsement, rather than putting the policies on hold?For other policies, such as Connect, could we build a better notification process for those holds?  For example, there is apparently a hold on Florida CNP policies, and our UW team in Small Business was not aware of that until agents started calling to ask about their renewal policies. These holds are causing much frustration for our agents, and we are now facing a substantial loss of business due to our renewal policies not going out in a timely manner.  This is a serious issue. Thank you for your insight.

__label__Workers-Comp Hi Jayson – I have a question regarding one of the Policies that has been selected for testing and am not sure who to direct it to. As part of the Procedures for the WCRIB audit we are required to calculate the ratio of aggregate deductible to the countrywide standard premium (prior to application of any deductible credits).In our testing of policy number 2074978000 with an effective date of 06/1/2015 we noted that the countrywide standard premium came in at $355,573 – when compared to the Aggregate Deductible outlined in the Financial Agreement (Plan Maximum of over $10M) the ratio came out above 3.0 and is considered to be noncompliant with Massachusetts regulation 211 CMR 115 per the WCRIB MA standards.Do you know who I might be able to reach out to in order to get an explanation of why this policy was written given that the ratio threshold is breached? Apologies if this is not something you handle, I just figured I would start with you on the Underwriting side.One thing I did notice in going through the Financial Agreement is that there may be another workers comp plan associated with the deductible plan (WC 2074977994). Perhaps we should be considering this in our ratio calculation.Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can provide any documents to move this request along.

__label__Package-Property ​Good morning, I want to let you know about an issue with the CAT pricing tool. Tom Jones reached out to me because he was running analyses with reinsurance and the AALs were changing but the guide premium remained the same. I determined there is a problem where the tool is passing the gross AAL for the guide premium calculation instead of the net AAL. The guide premium calculation is correct if spot fac is modeled but not layer.  The result is that the guide premium could be overstated. I have corrected the issue and we are releasing a new version of the CAT pricing tool this weekend. Julie

__label__Not-LOB-Specific ​Please provide guidance from a claims and legal standpoint. The agent below does not like our ROR language.Mike The point that I am seeking to clarify is not the policy language. Every letter cites policy language that may apply to exclusions. In this claim, both CNA and the other carrier denied this claim based on current facts and information available to them today. No difference by either up to this point. However, the closing paragraphs of each letter appear quite different.   1.    Carrier A. This simply says the insurance carrier reserves all rights and defenses under their policy of insurance. 2.    CNA - CNA's policy says we reserve the right to seek reimbursement from ….the insured… of all its attorneys' fees and costs we incur in defending those claims, and all indemnity payments we make to settle those            claims or satisfy any judgment on those claims, National Fire reserves the right to institute an action seeking reimbursement of such defense of settlement of sums. If it is later determined that CNA has no duty to          defend.Here's yet a third example of an actual claim where the carrier paid defense costs but ultimately determined there was no duty to defend:3.     Carrier C - Other than as provided under the Investigation, Defense And Settlements and Supplementary Payments sections of this contract, we have no other obligation or liability to pay sums or perform acts or services under this coverage. In its disclaimer of coverage, the xxxxxx Insurance Company advises that any action taken by the xxxxx Insurance Company, its agents, representatives or attorneys, is not to be construed as a waiver of any rights and/or defenses available to the xxxxxx Insurance Company under the terms, conditions, provisions and exclusions of the policies issued, nor shall it bar the xxxxx Insurance Company from asserting at a later date, any rights or defenses that may be available now or in the future. The xxxxx Insurance Company reserves the right under these policies and applicable law to cite additional policy provisions as may be appropriate.  The foregoing disclaimer of coverage is premised upon the facts set forth in the notice of claim as well as the terms and conditions of the policies.  By limiting policy references to those cited, the xxxxxx Insurance Company does not waive any other policy provisions.  The insurance policies in their entirety are incorporated by reference as if they had been stated in full. As you can see, Carrier C simply appears to state they have the obligation to Investigate, Defend, Settle and make Supplementary Payments as provided for in the policy language. CNA's language appears to imply there is a basis for CNA to seek reimbursement if it is determined there is no coverage after they incur expenses to defend and obtain a cause and origin expert.  The verbiage from Carrier C was from an actual denial letter after the carrier had incurred legal expenses to defend and obtain a cause and origin expert. Then it was determined there was no coverage. The carrier did not go back and seek reimbursement from the insured after it was determined that coverage did not apply. I don't know about you, but I'll take my chances with Carrier C's wording any day over my chances with CNA's wording.  I'm trying to understand what has happened to a carrier's duty to defend until coverage is determined by the carrier whether coverage applies or not?! This is where I am asking when did the burden of determining if coverage applies is now placed on the insured? If it doesn't apply, some carriers may want their money back. Other carriers appear to have policy language that says they have a duty to defend until the carrier determines there is no duty to defend. That's the way it used to work but I guess some carriers are changing. Has CNA become one of those carriers?

__label__Package-General-Liability HiI found the screens used by underwriters for OCP and RPL.  These are designed for internal usage since it show what would require a submission depending upon job specifics.However I can no longer find Application versions that can be used by the agent to fill out.  I looked in CNA Central also and did not find a copy (previously they were there and screen also refers to applications for the agent available on CNA Central).Are there applications out there anymore?Let me know - thanks. 
__label__Workers-Comp ​Please answer the following question highlighted below in yellow … In Texas there is a form DWC 83-85 for this issue.  What about Delaware?We have a contractor, Conaway who will be subbing a job out to another subcontractor.  Conaway does not have work comp insurance but the subcontractor he will be using does & he sent us a copy of that insurance.  I have attached a copy of the certificate here.  Are we going to be okay with not having a work comp certificate for the contractor we have the contract with but having a certificate for the subcontractor actually doing the work?  Is there something (statement, waiver, etc.) we can get from Conaway and/or the subcontractor that would remove liability from us?

__label__Auto Michael.   I am wondering if you can help me.  My insured is APMG also known as Minnesota Public Radio.  Their employees may be using ride sharing services on business.  I know we have the livery/conveyance exclusion on our auto policies and I assume that would preclude any excess coverage on our policy over that of the driver and uber.  Am I correct in that? I know if an employee is in an uber while on business our WC would respond and then could go after the uber policy through subrogation.  What I'm wondering is what if we have a third party with our employee such as an independent contractor or someone the insured is interviewing or who is helping our insured with a story.  If that person is injured in the accident and they sue our client, is our client bare or would we somehow be excess of uber's policy through our auto or gl?  I read the auto exclusion in our GL policy and I'm uncertain how it would respond to a situation like this.

__label__Auto ​This account I believe is yours.  There has been some issues with the auto in the past, and currently the Auto policy will not attach to the RST. I have worked with IT all week and it just won't attach, and they don't have any work arounds for this.  I have talked with LOB about this account.  They know that this won't go into RST now,  but due to the size, want to be a part of this renewal from when you start working on it through booking.  Rate Change calc won't be possible until this is booked and in Merlin, so as long as this is an open dialogue, we can work through those issues as this renews.  As a result of this, when you get closer to wanting to start working on the account, and you have all of the updated information in TAP and rated, please send me an email.  I see that you have used XPR for the last 2 years, and LOB is very against this.  If you let me know when the account has been updated, I can have someone manually calculate the emod that would be reflective of what RST would produce. TAP has been updated. Who do I need to contract to assist with the Experience Rating?

__label__Auto Mike:Accellos Holdings (dba TrueCommerce) is a developer of b2b supply chain software being quoted as new business effective 2/1/18.  As follow up to our earlier conversation, I've received pushback from our broker about our hired auto coverage, which was quoted as excess.  Current program (Travelers) is primary and the insured apparently has made it a point to ensure that the personal insurance of employees is not primary in the event that they rent a vehicle for company business.  Hired/nonowned auto is being quoted in support of a ~$180k software risk including domestic and international P&C as well as professional/E&O for a key Pursue Aggressively agent and TechAssure partner, IMA.  WC schedules reflect nine employees with outside sales duties who may be renting vehicles for company business.  Insured estimates $70k cost of hire for the year and rating accurately reflects this.  Risk control involvement upon binding would include review of all controls in place for the exposure and recommendations needed to meet minimum CNA best practices. Loss history:  Aside from two WC claims totaling <$1k, Automobile is the only line of business on the account that has had any loss activity in the past nine years.  Overall account loss ratio in this time period is well under 10%.  Seeking approval to amend hired auto liability to primary in order to match the current terms afforded by the incumbent market.  Please let me know if you need anything further from me.  ​

__label__Package-Property ​May you please research how our coverage would respond.---------------------------------------------------------------------------I wanted to give you an update on the insured's business.  A lot of this was covered with Danielle when we first wrote the insurance, but the company has never really had any operations per se in the last two years.  They are now gearing up to be fully operational in the next few months.B4CC's business is for a cancer patient to sign a directive taking ownership of his/her excess cancer tissue from surgery, and have that excess tissue collected at time of surgery by the oncologist surgeon, sent to a pathologist to validate the tissue,  and then store that tissue for the patient for possible access to clinical trials, drugs and therapies individualized for his/her particular type of cancer.   The patient will pay an upfront fee for such process,  and then a monthly fee for the storage.   In the beginning (when we first wrote the policies), the contracts were with the surgeons.  That has been scrapped and now all contracts are with the patient.  For your file, I have attached the final agreement with their laboratory and the final patient consent forms. B4CC is planning on utilizing BioStorage Technologies for the biobank storage.  I have attached the signed contract in place with BioStorage for your file as well.  I do want to clarify coverage for the tissues being stored at the biobank.  If an event at the biobank (like an electrical malfunction or a fire) renders B4CC's tissue unusable, would the policy respond?

__label__Monoline Hi Mark, I'm looping in the Field Resource center on your concerns/feedback with how EPC routing works which is where this type of feedback should be submitted.You received this notification because you set up the task and not your UT. As we have discussed my team does no manual assignments in EPC and this all routed based on EPC routing rules.The notification that your UT received, based on EPC routing rules, was not a rush when it was submitted as a New business Rate. The rerate that was submitted was a rush which is not tied to the rating or notification he received. This would not be something my team would manage and is feedback for FRC for clarification.  I appreciate the feedback that you are providing however FRC and your direct manager would be the appropriate outlet to discuss your concerns/feedback on EPC which all of this falls under.

__label__Package-Property Good afternoon,I am looking for assistance on a recent endorsement request that is impacting an open claim for WW Contractors.  The agent shows a recent endorsement increasing the Employee Theft coverage from $50k to $500k.  I would like to know when this endorsement was received and the effective date, and whether this coincides with the Employee Theft loss of $115k. Your quick attention to this matter would be much appreciated.  Please reply all, as the adjuster, Andrea McIntyre, is included in the conversation and has interest in the proceedings. 
__label__Auto ​Expiring auto premium is not importing into RST and neither is the loss history. The loss history is showing in the RST screen and EPC but I'm getting an error on the Dashboard screen saying the 3 year loss history is not being utilized.

__label__Monoline Hello,I have assigned a rush task in EPC. I need to have a correction reissue done on this policy to include the Earth Movement that is attached in DMF.  I attached the EM and Rain, Sleet, Snow Manuscripts in DMF when this was sent over for issuance but the EM Manuscript wasn't attached to the policy print.  Monica, we have been seeing this happen more often lately.Please advise once completed so that I can send the agent a copy of the complete policy print.  Thank youHave a Great Day!

__label__Auto Hope all is well. Julie Hart has referred me to you regarding an auto composite rating question I had on an account.   This account has 100 vehicles with different deductibles based on cost new (which is based on our guidelines).When we transfer over to a composite rating format how do we handle the deductibles?  All vehicles are CT.Currently, the auto composite rate endt has a blank text extension that I have listed all the current vehicles and their deductibles.  I also include wording that any mid-term additions are subject to UW review.  It was my understanding that the beauty of composite rating is minimal touch during mid-term when adding and deleting vehicles, so reviewing each one defeats that purpose.   That being said, how do we apply the correct deductibles to the vehicles?  Can I create some sort of legend within the endt based on cost new?Thank you,

__label__Workers-Comp ​Ernst: Hoping you can assist on this – Our insured recently got a new PE firm backing them and they have undergone a name change and restructuring.   I'm told by the PSR that I cannot change the first named insured on this WC policy without adding additional named insureds as the entity is a limited partnership and this policy is for California only (this was a non-issue on the AOS).  Attached is the post-transaction org chart - they have requested that NMC Hermitage LP be listed as FNI on the policy; however payroll actually comes from three entities below this FNI (IQNavigator, Inc, Beeline.com, Inc, and Beeline Operations Corp).  Thus my question to you – with California apparently requiring that we add additional named insureds since it is a limited partnership and our payroll already appropriately 'linked' to the entities with the payroll, should we be listing the 'co-investors' as outlined on the org chart, NM Beeline Co-Invest, NMC Hermitage GP LLC, management? I look forward to your thoughts in order  to get this cleared up and have the endorsement processed.  Thanks in advance.

__label__Auto Hi Mike,I need some quick assistance on this one. I have a General Contractor with an composite rated auto policy. On that policy I have the standard BA+ in lieu of the CBA+ apparently (didn't write this but have renewed it).Therefore per my understanding I have rental reimbursement coverage  at $25 per day up to $375 on ALL units regardless of vehicle class.To further complicate the issue I have the rental reimbursement form on the policy where the description of covered autos is On file with company where coverage is provided at $50 per day max $1,500.I have a claim in which claims is advising there is not coverage for RR due to it being a light truck and not scheduled for coverage.It's my take that there would be coverage for this unit at a minimum of $25/$375 and likely $50/$1500  due to composite nature of the auto.Please let me know ASAP. Thanks.I've included attachments for 2018 renewal quote letter, BA+ (ignore that I titled CBA+ as it's actually standard), and Rental Reimbursement.

__label__Auto ​There are a few issues with this RST that neither I nor my underwriter can figure out. 1. On the auto, it shows that there is 1 unit that has a deductible lower than $1,000 but I have verified in TAP that all units have $1,000 deductibles. I cannot figure where this information is pulling from, as it is incorrect. 2. The SIC description is incorrect and may be throwing off the modeling. The SIC description in RST is showing Diving- Marine, but the description in UWS shows Swimming Pool Cleaning and Maintenance. We need RST to reflect the Swimming Pool Cleaning and Maintenance description. 3. The UW also feels like the modeling is incorrect on the Auto and GL. Per the UW, I made some pricing adjustments and it made the GL a tier 1 (which is fine even though I pulled premium off and the tier went DOWN….), but the auto went from a IV to V without me changing anything. Not sure if there is anything going on behind the scenes on this one, but we would like another set of eyes to look at this and make sure the modeling is, in fact, correct.

__label__Auto My understanding is that when you add the BA Plus endorsement to an auto policy… employees are insureds.  In reviewing, the AI extension applies to an EE only while operating a hired/rented auto under a contract in that EE's name. The agent is asking for the attached ISO form.  It appears to protect the EE should an at-fault accident occur while the EE is operating his/her personal auto on bank business.  Extends the HNO coverage to protect the EE, not just the bank. Can you let me know if CNA has an endorsement like this?  And if it is something that we would be ok adding for a Financial Institution customer.

__label__Package-General-Liability Dear FRC:This is for our GL expert …If we have office buildings on an LRO basis … we would rate using GL class code 61212 or 61217 or now C.N.A. 80112.   Now, if there is outside parking … it is included in the rate structure for ISO 61217 (or C.N.A. 80112).   No issues there.My questions is …If there is a separate parking garage … so, not open air outside office complex parking … but rather a physical parking structure, per UWS what is the best class cod to use ?Can we included it in the LRO 80112 rate and not charge for it ?  I would not think so.UWS provides us with several options but the only ones based on SQUARE FEET … versus sales … is 46607 (but this is really more for shopping centers). 46604 and 46603 (parking – public open air and not open air) is based on SALES.  This does not work, not the nature of this exposure.So, the only remaining LRO office parking structure complex class code is 46622.     Would you agree ? Any thoughts from your prior xperience at C.N.A. wrting LRO's ?
__label__Auto So when I read the Schedule and apply section A. of the form to determine if my location has coverage for the hail damage,  I'm missing a premium amount, but I'm more concerned about the placement of the $2.5M limit. The schedule gives me 2 options under Comprehensive Coverage – the insured could either have coverage for 3 specified causes of loss OR have coverage for All Perils, depending on which portion of the box is completed with limits and a premium charge for the scheduled location. It seems odd that coverage would be split that way when there is a separate section for Specified Causes of Loss (SCL) with the identical options. And usually an insured has one or the other – Comp or SCL, with SCL being a cheaper premium since you only have coverage for the specified perils. And when you read the rest of the GKKL form, the insuring agreement has the classic language we find in the Auto policy. But when I am looking at this form, as written, I don't see how I can conclude I have coverage for the hail damage since there is no limit shown for All Perils under Comprehensive. I asked Wendy since she has more experience than I with the GKKL form, and she was reading the endorsement in the same manner – no coverage for the hail damage.   But I am getting resistance to this analysis. Could you give us your thoughts on this?Thanks Mike!

__label__Auto ​Hi FRC team, we need your help with an important auto rating issue that we're starting to run across pretty frequently now, since EPC started rating the auto.  There's actually two issues, but the more important one is that we have some concerns around EPC's process for determining eligibility for the physical damage schedule rating.  In the past, we've never had the PhD show as 'ineligible' for the schedule rating.  Can we find out what rule or filing has changed for determining this eligibility or was RST just not rating correctly?  Let us know if you have any other questions on this. The second issue is that why is EPC even allowing  the policy to rate when the rating includes an ineligible mod?   Should this generate one of those red error messages asking you to fix before it'll rate?      Thank you much!         
__label__Auto Mike,We are running into a claim issue with Spaan Tech, Inc (6018570472) regarding towing coverage for a light truck.  In 2016 the account had all light trucks on the schedule, and the underwriter was told by LOB that the 'intent' of our BA Plus, even though the trigger for towing is driven by coverage on a PPT, is to cover towing for Light Trucks and that we were going to be adjusting the BA Plus to give coverage to light trucks.  The underwriter told the agency that the intent of coverage would be to cover the light trucks for the towing coverage since there were no ppts on the policy.This last renewal, they ended up adding some PPTs to the schedule, but didn't add the towing coverage to the PPts.  We have been submitted a towing claim on a light truck, so technically there is no coverage trigger based on the BA Plus. I don't know if the claims department has been granting coverage for light trucks towing coverage based on C N A's intent.I wanted to get your thoughts on this as we are in a tough spot with the agency and I don't know if a reformation will need to be done.Let me know if this makes sense or if you have any questions.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Good morning, I need immediate assistance on this account regarding the cancellation status.  Per my correspondence below, this account was set up on Direct Bill in error and should have been Agency Bill.  The agency has billed the insured accordingly, however, now the insured is receiving NOC due to the direct bill status.  Please advise how to 1) prevent cancellation status and 2) how to correct the billing status to agency bill. Thank you!
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Good afternoon, I was looking for some clarification please regarding mid-term BOR procedures.  What is the process if the new agent wants to be in the system as the new agent?  Do we have to cancel / re-write the policy with new policy numbers?If they don't want to do that, what are our other options? I am envisioning the scenario where the new agent sends an endorsement request, and then our system processes it under the old agents name.Thank you,

__label__Auto Team, There was an issue on a policy wherein a number of trailers and autos were not granted comp/collision coverage.  While this is what was bound by the agent, there appears to have been a series of miscommunications and it was the intent of the agent to provide that coverage for their insured.Nancy Osborn and Kevin Albright have approved a policy reformation, claims has been notified, and a premium waiver is going to be put in place.  My question is, do I need to send a separate endorsement to initiate the Reformation or does that get initiated when claims becomes involved in the Reformation process.  Currently the corrections are not showing in imaging and we need to get the claim closed out as quickly as possible.

__label__Monoline FRC,Please review the attached.There have been multiple reporting changes on this policy that has led to quite a bit of confusion on this policy and what endorsements and the associated premium that should remain on the policy.My interpretation is that the $34,506 endorsement and the subsequent ($2925) are finally correcting the reporting premium for the November 2015 – October 2017 reporting term.I am trying to determine what the (19,525) is returning. Is this all of the premium that had been previously billed for the November 2015- October 2017 Term? If so, I can't get the math to match up.Shouldn't the $34,506 and (19,525) have Nullified the $5216, $8433, ($4,062), $6468, $6157 and $3781 as all of these Endorsements were generated from reporting that was subsequently corrected?The agreed to Premium with the Agent and Insured from the last updated reports is $34,506 - $2,925 = $31581We can deal with the $32 endorsement at a later time.

There is no mention of MO compliance in UWS or DMF. Please provide updated proof of MO compliance being met. I have included the job aid link below, showing that we are not allowed to proceed with issuance until this information has been confirmed.  Our hands are tied as far as issuing the policy with MO on it until MO compliance has been met and we have proof that the agent is licensed to write insurance in the state of MO. If the policy needs to be issued for premium close, and you are not able to obtain the necessary proof in time, we can remove MO from the policy and issue accordingly until it is obtained, at which point MO can be added back on via endorsement. Please advise if you would like us to do that; otherwise, FRC can further assist you regarding the matter of MO proof of compliance if needed. https://refdocs.cna.com/WorkplaceXT/getContent?objectStoreName=kbos&id=release&objectType=document&vsId={101A2557-0900-C2A4-8008-E878C393C3C6} 2.     PREMIUM DIFFERENCE:Please be advised that the final NCCI EMOD is .58 (in lieu of the tentative .57 rating that was previously quoted for the state of AL). After updating the policy in accordance with the NCCI bureau, the new premium per EPC is $189,670 in lieu of $189,678 on the binder instructions. Please advise  if okay to proceed with issuance.    3.     PREMIUM CLOSE WEEK (Wed, Thu, Fri):In light of premium close, we will proceed with issuance using the no specific locations  & the duplicate FEIN entry. Once the information is received, the policy can be updated via endorsement.

__label__Auto I have worked on my 1st August renewal with auto.   I have several questions I am hoping to get clarified.  Some are policy specific and some are general.I apologize if some of these have been addressed in the webinars but I don't think they have.   Policy # bua5093737332: There were no notes for auto on the rater/tech form. Have the August renewals not been reviewed by the PSR's? On the Modifier screen it shows the schedule minimum .60/maximum 1.40 for state (Wisconsin). The liability schedule modifier shows not eligible.So we can only use 15%.   Isn't it confusing showing the .60/1.40.  Will EPC come back with an error if more credit/debit is used than 15%? Experience rating – I see the Detail Prior Carrier field is no longer in RST.  On the Modifier screen in EPC there is a place for loss data input.  I assume this is wherewe will now input auto losses to experience rate.   My question - on NB,  I would always input the individual losses into RST since it is extremely hard toannotate this on loss runs.   Will we have the ability to do this in EPC prior to WWO rating?  Policy has manuscript endorsement where a loss payee/add'l insured lessor was added to Hired Coverage.  My understanding is that there are no manuscripts so how would we do this. Policy has waiver of subrogation.  I see on the forms screen that this must have the same placeholder that we have to have on WC policies. I pulled through the 2nd one that will be used for ADC.  Will this be done by PSR and will they add the ADC from prior policy. Cannot pull symbol 8 and 9 to the medical payments on covered vehicle screen even though we have it on the Commercial Auto Line Screen.    I see what I think is a new form CNA85611xx Address of Business headquarter Location – what is this and who completes it. Some general questions: There typically are manuscript texts on composite auto – varying deductible's by vehicle type and varying medical payments limit by state.  This does not pull toDec since there are more than one limit.  Without having access to manuscript text, how will this be done in EPC.   I am hoping that this is not something that will have to go through Camillon. I have manuscript texts where we are stating that a vehicle has a crane attached, is there a specific auto endorsement that we can use to do this? Will the PSR let us know when there are manuscript text on expiring?  Will a location address need to be added for every state that we may be rating Hired Coverage in.  Can no specific loc be used.   If we aren't rating a vehiclein that state ,so we don't even have a city/town, how will that work.  Will we have to give the PSR's a city/town or can they default?    Thank you,

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello Ryan, The FSR department does not file WC policies to provide proof of coverage or verify filing for proof of coverage. If you receive this type of fine letter from an agent/insured please review the policy, link the names to the proper states, correct any incorrect Name, FEIN or UI # and issue the endorsement to file the proof of coverage with the state. Please see the attached Proof of Coverage document. All Workers Compensation files electronically for all carriers through WCPOLS by issuance of the policy or endorsement.NCCI and the states will only accept the electronic filing which is produced by issuance of the policy or endorsement.The electronic feed goes out in a batch to NCCI and the states in the evening. NCCI accepts or rejects the policy the next day.Independent  states have different schedules on when they accept the information usually 3-7 business days. What feeds electronically for proof of coverage?  If any of these items are incorrect on the issued policy the insured is uninsured. •           Name and legal entity –Must be an employing entity in the USA. •           Registered FEIN –Electronic filing for proof of coverage is by the FEIN number. Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number (EIN) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. A FEIN Number is registered for each named insured. Two named insured cannot share the same FEIN. •           Registered Unemployment number - ME,MN,NY,RI,UT.  HI requires a DOL# and NJ requires a NJTIN •           Class code, payroll. •           The information will only be fed to the state the Name is linked to on the policy. Each Named insured and FEIN, listed on the policy, must be linked to the state location or locations where it is registered to file proof of coverage. A name can be linked to multiple state locations. This information must match what the insured  registered with the State Labor Bureau and WC bureau or it will be rejected. Remember dates matter.Always change mailing  address at inceptionAlways add a location at inception or the date the insured hired its first employee in a state.Once the state accepts the date of coverage you cannot change to an earlier date without flat cancel and new policy number as new business for New York

He has attached two examples above.    I can answer his other question about the 'check digit' not showing on the policy docs.The other issue I have is that whenever an audit is revised, the policy is rewritten with a new premium that does not match the prior policy plus endorsements.  We then need to offset the original policy, endorsements and audit in order to rebill the rewritten policy and revised audit.

__label__Not-LOB-Specific ​Hi FRC team, I've recently gotten a couple questions from different branches around UW authority/referrals for Fast Track accounts that I was hoping you could answer for me: Expired Underwriting Referrals – The Fast Track roles & responsibilities document only says that the UW should send a referral for checklist triggers that are outside their authority.  However, there is no longer a question regarding referrals on the checklist.  Are UWs still responsible for submitting referrals on items outside their authority if a 1-year or 3-year referral is expired? UW Authority Carrying Over from Previous Year – If an UW handled a renewal previously who had authority for the terms & conditions of the account, but the new underwriter on the account has no authority, are we correct in understanding that the Fast Track renewal is supposed to operate under the previous year's authority and therefore no referrals are needed?

__label__Auto Hi,Can you please take a look at these three endorsements for me?  I have numbered them.  You can see the agents comment below but what happened was that the agent sent in a request to have 2017 Honda 2HKRW6H37HH223870 added effective 12-21-2017 and delete 2014 Honda 5J6RM4H53EL049051.  This was done on endorsement #1.  Then they sent in a request telling us that this was the incorrect 2017 Honda that was added  and they needed for 2017 Honda 2HKRW6H30HH210295 added effective 02/28/2017.  This was done on endorsement #2.    The problem now comes up on endorsement #3.  Endorsement #3 is correct that it is deleting the incorrect 2017 Honda 2HKRW6H37HH223870 but the premium amount that it is showing doesn't make any sense.  It has one of those future effective premium pages.  This one is looking like it is returning $1,443.   Endt # 1 added 2017 Honda 2HKRW6H37HH223870   AP $698  (incorrect vehicle to add)Endt #1 also deleted 2014 Honda 5J6RM4H53EL049051  RP $655Total AP for endt #1 $45Endt # 2 adds the correct effective 12/28/2017     2017 Honda 2HKRW6H30HH210295  AP $716Endt #3 is deleting the incorrect 2017 Honda 2HKRW6H37HH223870   but the premium doesn't look correct.  RP $727 and RP of $716.   I just need to be able to explain to the agent what is going on here.Thanks, Kelli​

Pol # 6014739363There are two composite classes on the program. One is rated on area and the other on units. Currently the rates are as follows,Area = 9.886Units = 22.498We need them to be,Area = 10.157Units = 19.312Could you please assist me with getting these rates where they need to be in the composite rating? 
__label__Package-General-Liability Agency bill has advised me that they're unable to provide an accounting for account 0115472330 as it's too much work.  Is this something the Field Resource Center can help with before I pass along the message to the agent?
__label__Umbrella ​I need some more info on this as well.  Account in question is 0112024271 What happened for the auto is that they had to increase some exposures yesterday, but when they did it, the underlying premium for the Auto did not update on the CUE LOB screen, thus not changing the premium. Secondly, they changed the GL to composite, and now the underlying premiums are different as well.  For Example, on the LOB Screen it shows:How can Prem Ops be more than what we are showing on the LOB screen?  It looks like we have the right total between the two, but it isn't divided up correctly.  This would affect charged. 
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Please see comments below.  We have a CNP renewal, company placement by Genesis, rated per expiring with no IRPM & capping mod applies.  Rate in RST is showing -64.7% but premium increase is 20%.  This was quoted this way today since the agent wanted this early.  There is no way we could have gotten a + rate in RST, even if we would have applied max 1.25 IRPM for NJ (and the premium would have been unacceptable).  Is there any other info you can share on this topic?  Also - CUE shows +66.7% but is minimum premium, same as expiring. The other glitch on the CNP policy is that this renewal needed to be rolled over by IT – Now if we need updates in TAP, we can make the changes & upload the policy, but IT still needs to rate it.  Not sure what will happen at issuance.  (this is the incident # referenced)
__label__Umbrella ​Hi Monica, Do we know why the system processed it with only 15 day plus 3 for mailing? Should we be concerned with other policies?

__label__Package-General-Liability - Quoting Per Expiring- Originally the ISO Code 15406 Rating basis was Payroll for Prem/Ops and Sales for Products/Completed Ops- When we switch to our proprietary code the Prem/Ops rating basis switched over to Sales as well.- This was not caught at the time and we continued to use payroll it looks like as the rating basis while it's now a basis of sales- LOB has advised that the rate for prem/ops remains a rate really intended for payroll but now showing rating basis of sales thus making the rate inappropriate for the risk.- Discussed with LOB and TCUO. Advised to use actual expiring sales then apply Rule 34 specific only to the Prem/Ops code to get my premium more in line.- Since we are using the expiring exposures I view this as approx. a +7-8% rate increase. Please review and override rate calculation.

Have the August renewals not been reviewed by the PSR's? On the Modifier screen it shows the schedule minimum .60/maximum 1.40 for state (Wisconsin). The liability schedule modifier shows not eligible.So we can only use 15%.   Isn't it confusing showing the .60/1.40.  Will EPC come back with an error if more credit/debit is used than 15%? Experience rating – I see the Detail Prior Carrier field is no longer in RST.  On the Modifier screen in EPC there is a place for loss data input.  I assume this is wherewe will now input auto losses to experience rate.   My question - on NB,  I would always input the individual losses into RST since it is extremely hard toannotate this on loss runs.   Will we have the ability to do this in EPC prior to WWO rating? Policy has manuscript endorsement where a loss payee/add'l insured lessor was added to Hired Coverage.  My understanding is that there are nomanuscripts so how would we do this. Policy has waiver of subrogation.  I see on the forms screen that this must have the same placeholder that we have to have on WC policies. I pulled through the 2nd one that will be used for ADC.  Will this be done by PSR and will they add the ADC from prior policy. Cannot pull symbol 8 and 9 to the medical payments on covered vehicle screen even though we have it on the Commercial Auto Line Screen.   I see what I think is a new form CNA85611xx Address of Business headquarter Location – what is this and who completes it.  Some general questions: There typically are manuscript texts on composite auto – varying deductible's by vehicle type and varying medical payments limit by state.  This does not pull toDec since there are more than one limit.  Without having access to manuscript text, how will this be done in EPC.   I am hoping that this is not something thatwill have to go through Camillon. I have manuscript texts where we are stating that a vehicle has a crane attached, is there a specific auto endorsement that we can use to do this? Will the PSR let us know when there are manuscript text on expiring?  Will a location address need to be added for every state that we may be rating Hired Coverage in.  Can no specific loc be used.   If we aren't rating a vehiclein that state ,so we don't even have a city/town, how will that work.  Will we have to give the PSR's a city/town or can they default?  
__label__Package-Property ​Hello FRC team,    we were looking at the renewal property rating in RST yesterday and it appears the BPP total is not rating correctly and we also would like any insight on why the property rate went from .339 in 2017  to .396 in 2018 with no major changes made (see attached).   The BPP was written with a total value of $542,000 (see below screen shot) and expiring is totaling $576,000.  However, RST shows there was no change from 2017 to 2018 in BPP values.   It appears all property endorsements relating to the BPP were made after the 8/1/17  effective date as well.   We're thinking there may be a rating error somewhere that needs to be corrected.  We appreciate any feedback on this and hopefully by early next week, so we can continue working on this 8/1 renewal.  Thank you very much!

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello, I have a request to increase Employers Liability limits mid-term from $500/500/500 to 1M/1M/1M on an Electrical Contractor based in South Carolina. I was discussing this with an underwriter in FL, who was recently told that this was a problem and bad practice, and we would need to do a cancel/re-write rather than a midterm increase, since it was something that would need to be backdated to inception. I did have a test quote run through WWO to get the A/P, and they also advised the endorsement would need to go back to inception. Assuming we obtain a No Loss Letter, is there in fact an issue increasing EL limits midterm? If so, what is the reason?

__label__Workers-Comp Hello Kristen,The information that is sent to the WC bureau is electronic based on policy issuance. Please review the proof of coverage requirements and have the policy endorsed effective inception to correct the issuance errors and file proof of coverage with the states.What feeds electronically for proof of coverage?  If any of these items are incorrect on the issued policy the insured is uninsured. • Name and legal entity –Must be an employing entity in the USA. • Registered FEIN –Electronic filing for proof of coverage is by the FEIN number. Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number (EIN) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. A FEIN Number is registered for each named insured. Two named insured cannot share the same FEIN. • Registered Unemployment number - ME,MN,NY,RI,UT.  HI requires a DOL# and NJ requires a NJTIN • Class code, payroll.  • The information will only be fed to the state the Name is linked to on the policy. Each Named insured and FEIN, listed on the policy, must be linked to the state location or locations where it is registered to file proof of coverage. A name can be linked to multiple state locations. This information must match what the insured  registered with the State Labor Bureau and WC bureau or it will be rejected.

One for the older vehicles and one for the newer vehicles? I have not split up a composite like that previously. I also am curious if there is some actual direction on how to get the deductible information entered into the worksheet so that the policy reflects this accurately? I have just listed some comments in the worksheet previously, but it seems to be a little confusing. I am not sure who the correct Auto LOB contact would be, and I think this is one where talking over the questions would be helpful. Thank you!

__label__Package-Property Hi Team:Happy Friday.Quick question for you on a large LRO RNWL. I checked with claims actually as well and they were not able to really provide a definite answer.The situation is :We have vacant land leased to a dairy farm. NO physical property on the vacant land. The vacant land is scheduled on the policy currently … on the GL and coded as GL – vacant land.My question is, producer wants to schedule or rather have the vacant land scheduled on the policy for Business Income.  So, for some reason the dairy farm goes out of business due to a covered cause of loss and their policy for some reason expires or does not respond for some reason.  They want the $46,500 in annual rent as part of the business income coverage.  So, they want this GL location included simply as part of the blanket rental income.Is this doable ?

__label__Monoline Hi Karen, I have something I wanted to bring to your attention. I am not sure if this is something that is common when working in EPC, but we move documents out of the UWS PC2 CNAC Referral Documents area and input the document under the current year's file which we are working on. The most common document which I may want to move from one file to another is the Underwriting Analysis document. In Inland Marine Fast Track, this is our documentation, and Rebecca and I update this document rather than create a new one each renewal term.  I have noticed that I have been getting this error message frequently and it is only on a rare occasion can I MOVE this document from the USW PC2 CNAC Referral Documents area to another area. The below screen shot is the error message I  receive when trying to move the existing document. Is this something you are aware of? I have never reached out to the helpdesk. My workaround has been to save the UW Analysis document into my Documents and then ADD DOCUMENTS and rename it.Please let me know if this makes sense or if you would like to discuss further. Thank you and have a wonderful 3 day weekend!

__label__Package-General-Liability Hello this question was referred to my small business contacts (see emails below) and I was advised to refer this question to the FRC to work with LOB &/or Claims to get a reply.A quick recap of all the emails below – our Connect policy automatically provides $10,000 coverage for EPLI – the coverage is automatic and cannot be removed from the policy.  The insured has a separate D&O/EPL/Fiduciary/Crime policy in force. The agent's concern is that the other insurance provisions in both policies essentially assigns each policy as excess. They are wanting us to remove the coverage from our policy.

__label__Package-General-Liability Hello!I was advised to contact you regarding an appetite question.  Do we have any appetite for a TPA (Third Party Administrator) for property/general liability/professional lines?  If so, where, and how would this be classified for SIC (sales, service or consulting?) and what underwriting parameters exist?
__label__Package-General-Liability Hi!  I'm working to adjust pricing to hit rate targets in RST.  My Auto policy and my WC policy are both in EPC.  I can only work on one at a time.  EPC needs to have the ability for us to work on more than one policy at a time. Normally, while one is rating I'll go adjust the other policy.  Always, multi-tasking…..
__label__Workers-Comp ​If any WC policy with NY exposure was rated prior to 8/13 was it automatically rerated when the rates were deployed?  I don't want to assume anything as this is a 10% rate decrease.   Thanks.

However, when I followed the attached job aid to add it, TAP gave me an error message, please see screen print below. I contacted IT but IT advised that TAP is performing correctly. In order to have policy rated up, I had to add a BI limit of $1. However, this doesn't seem to be right, and the job aid doesn't indicate a BI has to be added in order to add CBI. Would you please advise?

__label__Package-General-Liability ​This policy for 17-18 term was supposed to be composite rated.  It was issued as non-composite.   The issued premium of $346,313  matches the composite worksheet.   A few weeks ago the agent realized the policy was not issued as composite, and she wanted reissued. I had the policy cancelled, and I did a rewrite.  The composite premium is $345,916.  Before the rewrite there were a few endorsements processed.  My question is I am not sure what she is asking below in Red.  Did I miss a step?Thank you

__label__Package-General-Liability Hi FRC team,I believe the Syracuse team may have reached out on this issue previously for another policy but got not response.  We are still experiencing the same issue and would like some additional information/guidance as to next steps.It appears that the rate on the Composite GL was changed somehow (not by UW or by WWO) after quoting and before issuance. Would you be able to review the below chain and advise the following?Is the Composite GL rate changing at issuance a known issue?Are you aware of why it is happening?Is there a workaround? If not, how do you suggest addressing?Please note that WWO has provided the following insight:Wanted to clarify, we cannot alter rates manually on our end and CNA does not lock in rates at quoting.  This is a common feedback item that we receive in the processing area, however we have no control over it as it is part of how the systems were built.Additionally, an IT ticket has been opened, but WWO has stated they do not believe IT will be able to actually correct the rate.We appreciate your attention on this matter and ask that it please be looked at urgently.  Please feel free to coordinate with me directly if you have additional questions or feedback.

__label__Package-General-Liability I need some help explaining endorsement output to the agent!  The attached endorsement is adding code 80168 (Loc 13) to the policy, and is not being included in the composite rating.  The part of the endorsement in question is actually the form being added asEnd't #41 – Policy Holder Notice – Premium Adjustment (CNA85110).  I have never seen this form before and I have no idea what it is for.  It is also very confusing because it is showing an additional premium of $18 which is incorrect.  The additional premium for the endorsement is $28.  You can see how this could be confusing to the agent or insured as to what premium is actually due.  Can you possibly explain what this form is for and why it is showing a completely different AP due?Thanks!

__label__Auto ​ThoI have a submission from Hylant here in MI that is pretty well outside the box. They are needing some help on this account, and they are key relationship regionally so we want to make sure we explore our options. The insured is Royal Enfield North America (RENA); and is a subsidiary of Eicher Motors who is based in India.  Eicher manufactures motorcycles, parts and accessories aimed folks who are looking for a gentler leisure ride and who do want to ride a Harley hog.   They started the business in 2015 and have been slowly growing.   Website is: https://royalenfield.com/usa/aboutus/overview/ [royalenfield.com] RENA is not a dealership, rather they are a distributor who contracts with motorcycle dealerships in the USA and Canada.  The dealerships sell and service the bikes, parts and accessories.  The insured's primary exposure is that they are frequently involved in promotional events in various areas in the country, mostly as a participant.  They are based in Milwaukee, WI where they have a corporate office and a showroom with bikes that are not for sale.  RENA utilizes Wisconsin  distributor plates to put on a bike when it is test driven by a prospective dealership, at a promotional event or anywhere else.  Non-employee riders have to sign waivers. There is no products coverage needed, so the auto is the primary concern. These events the insured participates in have third party individuals riding the insured's motor cycles. It seems that if an accident occurs this would mostly be a med pay situation? There were two minor accidents on the Travelers loss runs (attached). One was paid at $5K which sounds like med pay, and the other was $16K. I am hoping to get your thoughts on if this is something we can work through exposure/pricing wise?  I also have copies of the current Travelers coverage, a sample of the waiver agreement, the agreement they have in place with dealers, and some details on an upcoming even in Santa Cruz CA. ughts on this?

We only show the ones that do so we thought the same process would apply here.  I just wanted to make sure we were correct.  If we are not correct, something needs to get out to everyone completing these sheets very quickly.

__label__Auto  Hello,Can you provide some insight on the agent's questions below (also more thoroughly addressed in the attached email correspondence)?Endorsement  CA2001 (10/2013)  Additional Insured Lessor.  Not sure why this is on the policy? The policy essentially provides hired and non-owned liability and hired car physical damage. This endorsement would require the scheduling of a leased vehicle.Endorsement CA 9916 (10/13) see attachment 1 included in policy, or CA 9916B see attachment 2 (10/13) listed on the form schedule.  When I read both forms they read the same.  Again, as in item 1, I'm not sure why this endorsement is included in the policy?  It makes the owner of the vehicle an insured when they have leased an auto to the insured for a period of 6 months or longer.Does 'CNA have any type of broadening endorsement available in New York that we could review?

__label__Package-Property ​Can someone please take a look at the rating for this account and give me a call?  Something just doesn't make sense to me with the additional premium endorsements.Ordinance or Law – Demolition and Repair Costs – I want $2.5 Mil applicable to all locations on the schedule.  I understand this may charge a premium at every location.  However, the same $895 charge is being applied to every location, regardless of Building Value.  This cannot be.Denial of Access to Premises – Ingress/Ingress – The same $807 charge is being applied at all locations regardless of TIV, is that correct?  I believe this may be rated off the limit, so if this is correct, please remove this coverage from all locations.Flood – The same $899 charge is being applied to all locations regardless of TIV.  This cannot be.  These are Zone C or X locations, so the charge per location should be negligible. Debris Removal – I actually would like help just removing this from the rating.  The default $300,000 at the policy level is fine.  So I really need help fixing the Ordinance or Law and Flood rating on this.  I have run through this with Barb Wagner and we both agreed something just doesn't look right with the rating here.  There may be an issue with TAP or Insbridge (sp), but I really need help fixing this.  Thank you,

__label__Package-Property Please do not close this ticket.  Explanation does not make sense.  We do not change the coverage specifications on a form mid-policy term.   The endorsement that was processed did not change anything or even touch the MFG Prop Extension form.  Bob- I have included you since I 1st went to you and replied to call in as defect.FRC – do you have any information about thisSue OlsenThis is regarding incident  INC0579290 reported in service now. Problem reported: Policy number: 4027203435Policy prefix: PMTTransaction type and effective date: Endt eff 01/01/218 processed 04/11/2018Premium Impact: $Description of problem: TAP - CNA65653XX is now reporting 25,000 per OCC instead of 25,000 per LOC Resolution: Based on the reported problem , we are seeing that the dec 'PPDECA0094180' is generated for the endorsement transaction with effective01/01/218 processed 04/11/2018 .This will be generated when the  coverage 'Manufactures property Extension Endorsement' is added on the policy.In this the limit values will be printed based on the values entered in the TAP and rest all text is hard coded text which cannot be changed. So as per the system design it will print as 'Each occurrence' only. In  Renewal transaction form 'CNA62666XX' is generated for this coverage  and it  will show as 'Each Location'. The system is designed in such a way that  'Each Location' will be printing  only for the Renewal transaction and 'Each Occurrence ' for the endorsement transactions. Please let us know if you have any other concerns or else update us on case closure.

Please review and provide instructions on how to correct if possible.Your time and attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

__label__Umbrella ​Ania – hope all is well. Wanted to see what our practice should be regarding commission on Umbrella. For Paramount, we can apply a commission reduction factor, so we do have the ability to decrease the premium when commission is reduced via that factor. We never had a CRF for WC and just learned we are not filed for a CRF for Auto either, so wanted to check on Umbrella. We have many policies that are on 0% commission. For WC (and now likely Auto), we are going to amend the renewals with 0% commission to full commission, and the agents can subtract their commissions from the fees they charge the insured. Any idea if Umbrella has a Commission Reduction Factor filed in all/most/any states? Any thoughts?

__label__Workers-Comp ​FRC Team, Question regarding the blanket waiver of subrogation – last year we had the blanket waiver of subrogation with the wording that is attached.  Throughout the year we added specific waivers of subrogation that were required my contract. At renewal this year, in EPC we still have the blanket on the policy and was issued with the blanket, however the wording that was attached last year is not on the policy and only the specific waivers carried through. How do I go about amending this – do I send an endorsement request to have them add the wording per the attached to the renewal policy?  This is the first time where I have run into this issue. Please reach out with questions. Thank you! Best Regards,

__label__Auto Patrick,Here is the problem with the endorsement we filed in NY. The BUA policy form, CA 00 01 10 13, has a Handling Of Property exclusion on page four. ISO endorsement, CA 01 12 12 15, NY Changes In Business Auto And Motor Carrier Coverage Forms (attached), deletes this exclusion from the policy. Then, our new endorsement deletes the exclusion again and replaces it with a Handling Of Patients exclusion. Hence, our endorsement was disapproved because NY does not allow this exclusion as evidenced by the ISO endorsement (see attached email).The ISO endorsement above also deletes the Condition in the BUA entitled, Two Or More Coverage Forms Or Policies Issue By Us, and replaces it with the statement, This condition does not apply to liability coverage.I'm copying Mike on this to see if he sees any solution to this issue that I may have overlooked. I received a camilion request to do the GL version of this endorsement and I will let you know what I find in doing that endorsement.Thanks,John

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Hi Team, I need some assistance getting this situation straight. Our billing department believes there is an amount due for an endorsement but neither I nor the agent can understand where the charge is coming from. I tried to weed through the endorsements to figure it out but I can't reconcile where the charge is coming from. I have attached the email chain from billing to the agent. The charge in question is the $4,108 charge from 5/31. There is no endorsement in the system with that charge on it. I went through all the endorsements. The only thing I can figure out is the following charges add up to the $4,108. $1,549 on 4/9+$2,626 on 5/31=$4,175-$67 on endorsement issued 5/31=$4,108 That said, the endorsement issued on 5/31 (attached) does not show $4,108. Instead this shows a return premium of $2,626 and an amount due of $2,559. The agent is wondering where the $2,559 amount is coming from. Also, why does billing show an amount due of $4,108. Could someone please help me with a reconciled account of the endorsements and the premiums generated from the endorsements? Please let me know what the endorsement request was that generated each endorsement. I need this to be able to get this straight with either the agent or our billing department.
__label__Monoline Good Afternoon,The agent has inquired on the additional premium that was generated from the attached endorsement. The a/p for this endorsement was $6,927. Can you advise why the premium was so high? Also, would this endorsement change the max per occurrence limit as well? I did consider the extended policy term but I want to confirm the a/p is correct. Any assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you,

__label__Auto Good Afternoon.Hope you are doing well today.I am currently reviewing a new business opportunity for a freight forwarding operation.  I realize this is not a target segment for us, but I wanted to properly vet this opportunity for a good agency partner of ours.One of the items that I have some particular concerns around and was hoping for a little direction on, is the Hired Auto Liability (symbol 8).  The submission includes a request for auto symbols 8 and 9 w/ $1mil CSL on the underlying and a $10mil umbrella.The prospect does not own any vehicles and does not actually touch any of the goods.  The prospect really operates as a logistics firm, as they are not physically hauling or transporting customers' goods.  All goods are shipped via other independent carriers (independent contractors).  Carriers are required to have $1mil Auto Liability limits and they operate under their own authority (I don't believe our prospect even has a DOT# - but will confirm).  There are other methods of risk transfer in place as well – additional insured requirements, waiver of subrogation, 30 day notice of cancel, indemnification language. I have included a copy of the contract and insurance requirements utilized by the prospect with their carriers.  I have also included a copy of the supplemental applications that were completed.My primary concern is the potential to be pulled into an Auto Liability claim where a carrier in contract with our prospect has a lapse in their auto coverage, or is only carrying a $1mil Auto CSL (min amount required in contract).  In the event that the carrier has a lapse in coverage, or is involved in a serious claim that exceeds the $1mil limit, are we going to be pulled in on our Auto Liability under symbol 8 and also exposing our umbrella limits.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could please provide some direction around these scenarios and confirm if my concerns are well founded.  I am not sure if there is best practice to wall off this type of exposure, other than just not writing the hired auto liability. I would be happy to discuss further if you prefer to talk over the phone.Please let me know if you have any questions, or if you need any additional information from me.Thanks for your help and have a great day!

__label__Monoline ​Hi FNOL and Field Resource Center, Hoping you all can assist me with investigating this issue. The policy attached to the Marine loss was over 540 pages long and has, and as you can see from the attachment the policy pages are somewhat out of order. For example if you search for policy number 0124214 in the document it looks like they are all lumped together in the beginning and then it jumps to page 257 and then to 267. Is this supposed to be this way, is this how Claim Reporting pulled it from the system or could this be the way UW added it to the system? Any information you can share will help figure out what's happening with this. The Marine team also confirmed that this has happened more than once, but this is the example I was provided. Thank you,
__label__Package-Property This is an FYI only as an example of endorsement issues causing significant problems for underwriting and agents/insureds.  I want to provide FRC feedback as this is a good example of fairly common endorsement problems and I hope it helps with tracking future improvements.  No additional support is needed at this time as the branch has handled through work around processes.Please review below as the UW and UT do a nice job outlining what happened.  Long story short, an endorsement was processed changing deductibles with no premium impact.  An out of sequence endorsement was then processed (with an earlier eff date) that would not typically have premium impact, but ended up generating the return premium from the prior endorsement.  Now, the return premium from the deductible change is warranted and should have been priced appropriately at the time of the change.  The lag in the premium impact with a non-premium bearing endorsement did cause some unintentional drama with the transaction at large.Please let me know if you have any questions.  Again, no additional support is needed at this time.  Thank you,

__label__Umbrella Hello Field Resource Center team, Please note the above CUE policy in RST is currently showing a premium total of $1,000 on the renewal term, however expiring term is showing total of $2,015.  Can you please advise what is causing the difference in this case? If you are able can you please update the renewal premium for the above CUE policy to match the expiring in RST?
__label__Workers-Comp ​Please see the 3rd attachment -  17-18 Hammes  Wc #48 to 60.  This endorsement generated an additional premium of $9,133.   Endorsement is adding TN, ME, NV and NH.  I cannot figure out where the additional premium is coming from.   I talked to my agency bill accounting rep thinking it might have been premium from an installment that had not been collected yet, but he said no.     I need help in figuring out why this premium generated.  This is some urgency around this as agent is also contesting the audit.   
__label__Not-LOB-Specific Good morning,Please see the below email chain and the attached document.  Is this the correct code the agent is asking for?--------------------------------------- Swanda is looking for their NAIC code, I think you gave me company codes.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hi, Question on the information from the UW in blue. Is this possible to secure a classification review so the 0651 class code for PA can remain on the policy? Regards,
__label__Workers-Comp ​FRC copied on email:Good morning Thomas The reason for nonrenewal is due to loss experience. See attached notice.The nonrenewal notice was sent out to the insured on 06/15/2018 per the document in Mobius for WC6020032906 for the 08/04/2018 renewal. This was 50 days prior to the renewal date.WI is stating in their attached email that CNA must renew effective 08/04/2018 as the notice of nonrenewal must be sent60 days in advance to the insured and WI. WI web site is showing the policy was canceled  08/04/18 on 08/08/18 for  nonrenewal and reinstated eff.  08/04/18  received on 08/08/2018. Sent by CNA  systems.. No nonrenewal active. NCCI Web site is showing the policy was canceled/nonrenewal eff.  08/04/18  received on 08/08/2018. Sent by CNA  systems. This is after the effective date of the renewal Per state guidelines you will need to renew the policy effective 08/04/2018 as CNA did not  send proper notice. Thank you
__label__Package-General-Liability ​No changes in payrolls exposures, yet rate is showing -33%
__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello Kevin, The policy shows coverage was added for NY 12/1/17 and the FEIN and NY UI are correct. It looks like there were 3 changes completed effective 12/1/17.   You will need to place a ticket with the Help Desk so they can determine why the coverage was transmitted effective 12/1/17 and expired 12/1/17. 
__label__Monoline ​Any idea on who the UW is for this account?  it is not in small business
__label__Package-General-Liability CNP -Do you have any idea how the CNP calculates the renewal rate?  On the expiring policy the actual property rate was .055 and on the renewal it is now .07.  When I calculate the premium that we should be charging on the property based on the expiring rates and new exposures the premium should be $32,095 - we are charging $40,735.  The gl premium dropped from $11,048 to $2,461 but there is no way to increase that on the pricing since we can only adjust the IRPM.Expiring package was $41,989 - using new exposure for the property value and flat rate the comparison premium for renewal would be $43,143 and we are at $43,196 which shows as a -20% rate What can we do to adjust the actual premium with both the property and gl changing so dramatically.​
__label__Package-General-Liability Hi Team:Can you please assist with the statement/billing discrepancy for this account?  I am recommending, at a minimum, that we have a Statement of Account completed for Garden Spot (Account 0123036697) that also addresses the concerns raised in this email chain.  If we engage a Resolution Specialist, I am asking that this individual be available to have a conversation with the agency if further clarification is necessary; however, please have that individual consult with Jessica Landau or myself first.  Please review the chain below as there is mention of waiving/writing off premium and accounting discrepancies between out accounting system and the agent's.  Time is of the essence on this one, as the issue has been ongoing since May.  Your assistance is appreciated.

__label__Package-Property We have had an endorsement processed on the PMT 6046249715 policy for the 2017/2018 term. The endorsement was effective 12/20/2017 and processed on 01/03/2018. The endorsement amended the Personal Property at Location 1/Building 1 from $13,000,000. To $42,500,000. I can confirm that the TAP system reads $42,500,000. On the Subject of Insurance document for that coverage at that location. The endorsement printed showing that the limit of insurance for that coverage at that location as  $67,000,000. The premium is reflected correctly.   The Limit of Insurance on the Endorsement is not showing correctly. This does seem to be a print problem,  BUT it is an unacceptable print problem.  It also incorrectly reflects to the Insured that the limit is not as requested. Thank you

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Good morning, There are times when an agent will call about a particular risk to see if it is something we would be interested in.  Sometimes it's obviously out of our appetite. Others, it's kind of questionable and we take it up the line to see if we could do but ultimately decline the risk.  Since we have no actual application, we have no account set up to verify it's been declined. If another branch were to receive an application for the same risk, they would have no way to know it's already been declined and may feel differently.  So…..Is there a proper procedure for this scenario – to get it logged - without asking for the agent to send us an application? Thanks,

__label__Package-Property There used to be an additional coverage spreadsheet which outlined our authority for additional coverages on the property. The new authority letter include the additional coverage sections in the letter itself now. That said it doesn't include all endorsements or additional coverages. There is a line item however for All other policy sublimits which I presume we default to.That said one of the additional coverage is Global Property Extension. There is an additional portion of my letter which states that I only have authority for US territory only. Therefore I presume I am not sure if I have authority for the Global Extension or not (I guess I presume I wouldn't).However the more I thought about this and was reviewing some of the other coverage grants in the standard PMT SE coverages like Worldwide Media/AR , Mobile Computing Devices, Property In Transit provide some similar type non-US only exposure grants.This could also come up under Dependent Property – Scheduled as we have the ability to schedule non-US locations.This discussion was spurred by a question looking for coverage for approx. $35K of equipment and cameras that our insured Illinois College of Optometry was taking to Peru for a humanitarian mission. We do not write the International (Quoted Not Taken at renewal). Another carrier writes the international but does not include coverage for owned/leased/rented equipment. Therefore Lockton is exploring options.How often do we utilize the Global Property Extension? I can't say I've ever used it. Would we be willing to provide up to $100K limits on that?

__label__Auto Mike,I was able to speak with Larry on this and need to reach out to you as the form we used initially to provide coverage is a manuscript.I'm seeking approval to update the manuscript form that is offering glass coverage for the 2013 GMC Sierra by amending the form to replace the 2013 GMC Sierra with the 2018 GMC Sierra.Details on the endorsement request/vehicle change associated with this endorsement/policy are detailed in the prior sent e-mail.I've attached the original approval for this request going back to 2015.At renewal, would it make sense/be appropriate to update the classification to PPT from LT?  It would seem to fit the usage of the vehicle and would trigger the AZ Glass Coverage extension as well as have a rate that is more in line with PPT usage and the non-business exposure.As this is claim related,  I will have the reformation approval finalized here in the branch.I'm seeking the clearance on the manuscript endorsement change.Please let me know if there is any further information I need to provide.Thanks!

It is not clear to me.The definition of Personal Property does not specifically list Media. Personal Property excludes Property Not Covered which does list Media as excluded. Media is excluded from Extra Expense. But, there is a method of Valuation for Media which seems to suggest there is coverage somewhere. Does that mean it is only covered for Electronic Vandalism?   Can you please provide a bit of assistance?Thanks,Nancy

__label__Auto ​The auto premium details are not generating on the dashboard. I've tried unselecting & reselecting on the quote selection tab but it did not work.
__label__Auto ​Please contact me about sending clarifying information to the Branches.  There seems to be confusion, which is understandable based on this message below.  I am very concerned about what communication is going to the agents about this as I don't want to suggest we are circumventing statutory notice requirements but instead that we are operating under the terms of our contract in offering different rates by mutual agreement.  And, we do need to indicate to agents we will be sending new Direct Commission schedules shortly (as agents are asking and we can't do this on a one-off basis for the 2200 agents, which represent approximately 4000 Producer Agreements) This is not accurate legally, contractually nor has it actually happened.   Agency agreements are not updated yet, we were not yet notified (other than having this communication forwarded to me) that Small Business was excluded for certain or that this communication was going out.  There are statutory and contractual notice periods.  So, it is not possible for Producer agreements to immediately allow for commission changes technically.  Our Producer Agreements do allow for mutual agreement for rates other than those on the commission schedule.  Any communication from the Branches to their Agents should indicate that Direct Commission schedules will be forthcoming but, if agents would like to mutually agree waive the statutory notice period they are able to take advantage of the higher commission rates (need legally approved language but this is the gist of the message) . What I indicated to Brian Ciferri was that we were able to offer these higher rates prior to formal notice being given to the agents (notice = new Direct Commission schedules under their Producer Agreements) but that was based on mutual agreement. The process of sending new commission schedules is heavily manual and therefore can't happen very quickly, unfortunately.  
__label__Monoline ​Passing along rating tool feedback.All We have seen several excel rating tools not updating when you override rates or change deductibles etc. The reason is most likely the calculation options on the formula toolbar is manual and needs be changed to automatic Go to the Formula tab than calculation options than automatic . Let me know if you have any questions 
__label__Workers-Comp As Mariza explained, the WC policies for this account are a bit messed up. The issue for claims is that there does appear to be a gap in coverage (active coverage dates are highlighted in green in my spreadsheet), for the date when a loss occurred (DOL of claim E3371137 is 9/27/17). So there are no policy premium stats to code this claim to.
__label__Not-LOB-Specific Is there a document that outlines the requirements for compliance documentation?  For example, legal notices are they required for all states on the policy regardless of a mod?  Only for states with a unity mod (1.0), are they account level of LOB?   With this being a hot audit topic, we'd like to refresh with the team the appropriate file documentation standards required and are looking for some concrete documentation we can point to for the standards. Thanks!

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Something looks off with a recent change to the GL pricing.Original RST 6/20/2018 shows the total GL premium of $76,500 with .45 Discretionary Pricing.  Quoted discretionary price change -9.8 and quoted rate change of -7.7%  This updated RST amended the premium to $76,262 with .38 Discretionary Pricing. But drops the Quoted discretionary price change to (-21) and (-18%)rate.  If the premium only went down another $238 and the DFM down (-7%) how does the rate reduction jump from -7% to -18% rate?

I attached how the saved PDF would look after I saved it to DMF and per the letter the NY info would repopulate. As an example, when I opened the template it shows up in the image below. I replaced the producer with the agents name and filled in the remainder of the address, but the last line if I left it blank would automatically populate with what was previously there after I saved it to DMF. Going forward should, I just leave producer and not replace it with the agents name?

__label__Package-Property ​I am trying to increase the EE on a policy (6045853458) and the TAP Entry Job Aid says if you are increasing over the each loc limit to enter it as subject of insurance extra expense.   What it doesn't say is what amount you enter and whether or not you can blanket it.   So my questions are,  do you enter the full amount you need (in this case I need $150,000 EE policy level) at each location or the difference between what they automatically get ($100,000) which would be $50,000 each loc.  Also can I blanket that?  $50K at each location (3 locs). When I set it up as blanket $150,000 ($50K each loc) I am getting a return premium of $36.00.  when I added it as $150K each location and not blanket I get a larger RP.   I'm concerned that I may need to put in a ticket on it.  Seems to me that we should be getting an AP and not a RP. Can someone research it for me and let me know as soon as possible?  Let me know if you have questions.

__label__Package-Property ​looking at the expired property premium I see that there were coverage extensions added to the expiring that are not on the renewal yet it is comparing the total premium so it is apples to oranges.PMT5099440942 had coverage extensions included that charged for Utility Supply Failure Business Income Mobile Computing Devices Worldwide limit of 25000 Electronic Vandalism for $1,000,000 - these coverage extensions are not on the renewal - the premium associated with these extensions = $775.  Additionally the expiring term increased the crime limits under the property extension for an additional charge of $469. This made the entire property charges $1,668. Of that $1,244 are not associated with locations and are also coverage that are not on the renewal.  So I do not think that the rating calculation is done correctly since the coverage is not the same we shouldn't be comparing the total property premium and only the premium that there is coverage on both terms for

__label__Workers-Comp ​Good Morning, Can you please advise if we have the ability to provide foreign voluntary WC to our domestic policy. I pulled up the Voluntary Compensation and Employers Liability Coverage Endorsement WC 000311A and it mentioned that the Insurance applies: A.   How This Insurance AppliesThis insurance applies to bodily injury by accident or bodily injury by disease. Bodily injury includes resulting death.1.   The bodily injury must be sustained by an employee included in the group of employees described in the Schedule.2.   The bodily injury must arise out of and in the course of employment necessary or incidental to work in a state listed in the Schedule.3.   The bodily injury must occur in the United States of America, its territories or possessions, or Canada, and may occur elsewhere if the employee is a United States or Canadian citizen temporarily away from those places.4.   Bodily injury by accident must occur during the policy period.5.   Bodily injury by disease must be caused or aggravated by the conditions of your employment. The employee's last day of last exposure to the conditions causing or aggravating such bodily injury by disease must occur during the policy period. I've highlighted the section that appears to grant coverage for an employee out of the country temporarily. Would this constitute as FVWC on the domestic? Is it not our intent to rely on this wording for FVWC? I just want to make sure I fully understand this before responding to the agent since she mentioned that some carries offer this coverage. I've attached a copy of the endorsement. Angelica

__label__Auto ​Hi Field Resource Center, Can you let me know if there is an issue or a problem with sending electronic proof of coverage to the California DMV for the above captioned policy? The agent came to me to let me know that the insured received delinquency notices for proof of current coverage on the following Autos: 2016 Chevy Silverado (VIN # 80376)2005 GMC Sierra (VIN # 20778)1998 Chevy (VIN # 80430) The 1998 Chevy and 2005 GMC Sierra have been deleted from the above captioned policy effective 05/21/2018 so not really an issue with them, but why did the insured receive delinquency notices? We're the VIN #s provided by the agent wrong? The agent confirmed that the VIN # originally provided for the 1. 2016 Chevy Silverado (VIN # 80376) was wrong . . . Was this the error?Let me know what you find out when working with FSR so I can circle-back with the agent!Thank You,

__label__Auto Brian and Mike,The AVIS account continues to bring up some very interesting coverage needs/scenarios …AVIS is getting ready to sign a national contract with a major U.S. company to be the that company's rental car company of choice.   This would be similar to the agreement we have with AVIS here at CNA.Whereas most of these national contracts fall under AVIS's self-insurance program each agreement is different.  This specific agreement might require AVIS to show proof of insurance for the contract in the amount of $500K for liability.  If so, AVIS will need to utilize one of the policies we write for them as the paper for certificate of insurance purposes. The policy to use is the Certificate Only policy, BUA 2083558793.  This policy has a $1M limit, however, and AVIS does not want to extend limits beyond that which is required by the contract.  Can we, for this specific contract, provide a sub-limit of $500K in this instance?  Can we draft sublimit wording for a specific contract on this policy?I think we should be able to but I want to make sure we can mechanically do it before giving AON the OK.  Again, this contract still might be worded so as to have self-insurance apply but in case they need to evidence coverage they will need us to do that for them.And of course all coverage would be same terms and conditions – Matching deductible program with AVIS responsible for all ALAE.Thanks for the help – can I have your thoughts early next week?

__label__Umbrella ​Hello,As respects the email below from the PSR regarding a change in term dates on a current account, why are we not able to change the term of an umbrella policy? This particular account, 3008279550, MC Construction, has WC (2-23-17/18) and PMT, BUA & CUE policies (5-24-17/18).  The insured wants all of their policies to be 2-23-18/19 for this renewal, which means setting up new numbers for the May policies and changing them to 2-23-18/19.  This was done successfully for the PMT & BUA, however per the PSR's email below, could not be done for the umbrella.  We don't want to cancel the current May policies until we have taken care of the February renewal.  I can set up a new number for the umbrella as new business (2-23-18/19) and send it to be rated as new, then converted to renewal at binding – but that is additional work. We have had several instances where the umbrella term needed to be changed (occasionally on new business, and sometimes at renewal) and have had problems doing so.  Is there anything in the pipeline for an update to EPC umbrella to correct this?  We do not have the problem with WC, so it can't just be EPC. Please advise soonest possible.

__label__Package-Property Hi all – I would like for someone to review the attached endorsement requests that were sent in on one of my accounts.  Forefront Dermatology SCPmt6056960384.   This is a $500,000 account of Medical offices.When you pull the account up in Tap you will see that every location (118 at issue) has personal property coverage(which is all blanketed) , business income (blanket also) and a gl office classification document.  On the 1st request, the personal property was not included in the blanket and business income was not added.On the 2nd request, the personal property was not included in the blanket, no business income was added and no gl was added. I understand that the requests from the agent are way less than perfect.  1st endorsement, they do show bi but no limit and do give gl class code.  2nd endorsement they just show personal property.    I would think that the format of the policy would at least give pause to the PSR to reach out to the Branch.I cannot control the quality of information from our agents, I do try.   We all have to be diligent to make sure we are producing the best workproduct and service to our agents.   Unfortunately over the last few years, I feel that the WWO stance is, only do what you see, don't think.    Over the years I have dealt with extremely talented and smart PSR's, who are very capable of many good decision's.   Now the acct has been BOR to another agency and Branch.  My agent no longer wants to be involved.   I still have endorsements to process  butI need to go back and clean up the endorsements already processed.  I don't need any action on the part of WWO but  I thought this was somethingthat should be elevated.

__label__Workers-Comp Hi, I have taken over the above referenced account. The renewal is approaching, and we have two pilots on the WC policy. Reinsurance has not previously been placed, however the plane seats 12 passengers. After looking through the guidelines it appears that this number of seats requires purchase of reinsurance, correct? Also, I want to confirm that I should be looking at purchasing $4M per occurrence excess of $1M? I did see a caveat in the guidelines and I have included it below: Multiply the hangering states death benefit by the seating capacity of the aircraft, including crew (if crew members are employees).  If the plane regularly flies to states with higher death benefits, multiply seating capacity by the highest such state death benefit.  If the resulting figure is near or less than $1 million, then there's no point in purchasing reinsurance, since our minimum retention is $1 million.  If the product is $3 million, it may not be necessary to buy the full $5 million routine reinsurance limit.  Money we don't spend on reinsurance is money we get to keep to fund for regular claims and profit. My question around this is how do I find the state's death benefit? I tried searching for this but have not had any luck. I assume I need to do this math in order to see if reinsurance is even necessary… I know I have many question, so any assistance you can provide would be great. Thanks,

Late by 44 daysThe letter you attached is a fine letter to the insured for not having proof of coverage in the NY web site. The insured must reply to NY with the form completed.  If the insured lists the CNA policy WC616502207 NY will then look again  for the proof of coverage.CNA will be notified that the insured believes we have issued coverage. CNA will be required to send the policy electronically and pay a fine to NY and the other states for late issuance. If we do not  issue the policy NY will issue the fine to CNA and the insured. The insured can receive a stop work order and have their employees sent home if the state proof of coverage is not in the state WC and Labor bureau systems.The states do not accept a verbal or emailed coverage. All States require a policy be electronically sent to the state bureaus by the effective date of the policy or they consider the insured uninsured for WC. States on the policy:  Fines to the insured and carrier.FL  Fines at 30 daysMA  Fines at 30 daysNY   Fines at 30 daysTN  Fines at 30 daysTX   Fines at 10 days

__label__Umbrella ​Hi Kathy I discovered another example of EPC charging a higher premium when a policy was reinstated mid-term.  Unfortunately, because this is a fairly large account, the premium error is large as well. I have attached the Cancellation Statement showing the return premium of $69,176 when the policy was cancelled eff 1/18/18.  However, when the policy was reinstated, EPC charged $83,585 instead of the correct amount of $69,176.  I could not find a document for the reinstatement premium but it is shown in the EPC Transactions Tab as a 1/8/18 payment. So the EPC Reinstatement over-charged the Insured $14,409 in additional / phantom premium (83,585 – 69,176 = 14,409).  Unless I'm looking at it incorrectly, the $14,409 is money we are obligated to return to our Insured. As a result of this error, EPC is also showing the expiring premium incorrectly.  The correct premium for the 6/4/17-18 Term is $171,997 but EPC is incorrectly showing it as $186,173 in the 6/4/17-18 Term.  In the 6/4/18 Renewal, the Rate Monitor Tab is showing the Expiring Premium as $205,484, which is even more incorrect. Please have the errors corrected and let me know when that is completed.  Let me know if you need any further information.

__label__Not-LOB-Specific Hello – I wanted to bring to your attention the issue when trying to open excel documents in EPC.    When you put the check in the box so you can check out the document, I hit open, And then allowBut then instead of the excel worksheet opening, it just disappears in the background.  You then have to check it back in, check it back out and do the same process over again and then it seems to open.     It is not a major issue, but when we are trying to save as much time that we can throughout the day, this gets to be a tedious process.     I have also tried to hit the save instead of open when you first check it out, however then any change you make on the excel spreadsheet does not actually save.     Just something to look into.  I know other underwriters in our branch have the same issue. Thank you!

The response time when hitting the enter key to go from one field to another is too long.

__label__Workers-Comp Hello Tyler,All Workers Compensation files electronically for all carriers through WCPOLS by issuance of the policy or endorsement. There is no manual filing. NCCI and the states will only accept the electronic filing which is produced by issuance of the policy or endorsement. The electronic feed goes out in a batch to NCCI and the states in the evening. NCCI accepts or rejects the policy the next day. Independent states have different schedules on when they accept the information usually 3-7 business days. Please see the attached Proof of Coverage documentIf the all of the requirements for proof of coverage shown below are correct on your policy and it has been 3-7 days since the policy transaction was issued and WI is not showing proof of coverage, then a ticket will need to be placed with the Help Desk.What feeds electronically for proof of coverage?  If any of these items are incorrect on the issued policy the insured is uninsured. •           Name and legal entity –Must be an employing entity in the USA. •           Registered FEIN –Electronic filing for proof of coverage is by the FEIN number. Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number (EIN) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. A FEIN Number is registered for each named insured. Two named insured cannot share the same FEIN. •           Registered Unemployment number - ME,MN,NY,RI,UT.  HI requires a DOL# and NJ requires a NJTIN •           Class code, payroll. •           The information will only be fed to the state the Name is linked to on the policy. Each Named insured and FEIN, listed on the policy, must be linked to the state location or locations where it is registered to file proof of coverage. A name can be linked to multiple state locations. This information must match what the insured  registered with the State Labor Bureau and WC bureau or it will be rejected.Remember dates matter.Always change mailing  address at inceptionAlways add a location at inception or the date the insured hired its first employee in a state.Once the state accepts the date of coverage you cannot change to an earlier date without flat cancel and new policy number as new business for New York

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hi, I have a new business quote out to a PAD agent and there is a pricing discrepancy. If you can get back to me within the hour that would be fantastic as I need to get back to the agent asap. My question surrounds what factors get applied into the WC rates. My manual pricing is $220k (1.00 schedule mod). The agent said he conducted a manual calculation and came up with a very different figure. FYI this is a NJ risk so company change does not matter. The agent said they found the manual rate, applied the construction credit of 25%, the EMOD, schedule credit of 20% (max in NJ) and the an 8% premium discount and came to a premium of $135k. if we remove the 20% schedule credit his manual is $158k which is much different than my $220k. Are there other charges/factors that he is no applying? Attached is my quote. For your review.

__label__Package-Property Dear FRCCoverage question GL below please if you can help.  Thanks. Emrah,Our insured, Pars SVSP, has LRO properties in CA and NM that CNA insures.  They also own 2 huge manufacturing facilities in Alabama and Mississippi respectively that are on triple net leases.  On each building, the tenant pays for all taxes and insurance directly and it's not a pass through from the landlord.   Does CNA have a contingent triple net lease form that would offer building coverage if the tenants insurance failed to respond to a claim?  Or if tenant's insurance wasn't in place?  I know Travelers has this form and Liberty used to, but doesn't anymore.  The reason I ask is the insured is interested in this coverage on these buildings.  They would also purchase rental income and GL on these buildings.  Please let me know.
__label__Package-General-Liability Good afternoon!I am hoping I could get some help in viewing an endorsement that should have been processed by now.  I can't tell what changes were made by looking at the documents in Imaging.  I sent down a request to reverse the attached endorsement, effective 1/29, that added an entity to whom notice of cancellation would be sent.  The agent did not request this and wants it reversed.  Can you help me find the endorsement that reversed the original endorsement so I can confirm to the agent that it was reversed? 
__label__Auto Hi FRC Team,Is there any way to have a more descriptive endorsement transaction declaration that provides a little more context of what is endorsed?  The attached endorsement doesn't really specify what is happening to the 3 vehicles being endorsed so I can understand the agent's hesitation on wanting to provide it to the insured.

__label__Auto Hi,Why are the renewal activities for auto policies being returned without rating after the policy is issued.  Shouldn't these close like the other lines?
__label__Workers-Comp Hello,     I wanted to confirm something with you.  On WC Policy #6056873648 there is an officer exclusion for Steve Russell but no signed form is attached.  This is a California policy.  As per our guidelines we need the signed form or otherwise we need to remove the officer exclusion and update the payroll to $122,200.  I left the UT know of this and she said she doesn't know how the name got there and it doesn't belong on the policy.  She went ahead and removed the exclusion from EPC.  But I wanted to confirm with you if we are okay to proceed with the exclusion removed and to not adjust the payroll since the UT says the name never belonged on the policy and she doesn't know how it got there. Sincerely,

__label__Package-General-Liability Field Resource Team Member:Sarah's original request (bottom of this e-mail) was for me to generate an endorsement in house to provide a two tier composite rate. I have done some of these in the past, and it has always worked out.  This time the endorsement didn't print the next day, and the I was off a week.   The incident number for the endorsement not printing was INC0675460.Upon my return, Sarah showed me the endorsement which did print.  It is the first attachment above.  This includes future affected premiums for 3 non-premium bearing endorsements previously issued during the 2017-2018 policy term.  The endorsement itself doesn't seem to do anything.  The 3 endorsements processed are the other 3 attachments above. We are at a loss, and this has an effect on our billing.  Sarah asked for assistance, and the response from Accounting (Janice Wolski) is immediately below.We would sincerely appreciate your assistance in resolving this pressing issue.Thank you very much.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello Jessica, The FSR department does not file WC policies to provide proof of coverage or verify filing for proof of coverage. At this time, all of the additional named insureds on the policy only have proof of coverage in IL. The primary named insured is the only named linked to the other 11 locations. Please correct the policy via endorsement to link the additional named insureds to the locations they have operations and payroll to file proof of coverage in the states effective inception of the policy. For all insureds operating in NY, the NY Unemployment number is required. All Workers Compensation files electronically for all carriers through WCPOLS by issuance of the policy or endorsement.NCCI and the states will only accept the electronic filing which is produced by issuance of the policy or endorsement.The electronic feed goes out in a batch to NCCI and the states in the evening. NCCI accepts or rejects the policy the next day.Independent  states have different schedules on when they accept the information usually 3-7 business days. What feeds electronically for proof of coverage?  If any of these items are incorrect on the issued policy the insured is uninsured. •           Name and legal entity –Must be an employing entity in the USA. •           Registered FEIN –Electronic filing for proof of coverage is by the FEIN number. Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number (EIN) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. A FEIN Number is registered for each named insured. Two named insured cannot share the same FEIN. •           Registered Unemployment number - ME,MN,NY,RI,UT.  HI requires a DOL# and NJ requires a NJTIN •           Class code, payroll. •          The information will only be fed to the state the Name is linked to on the policy. Each Named insured and FEIN, listed on the policy, must be linked to the state location or locations where it is registered to file proof of coverage. A name can be linked to multiple state locations. This information must match what the insured  registered with the State Labor Bureau and WC bureau or it will be rejected.  Remember dates matter.Always change mailing  address at inceptionAlways add a location at inception or the date the insured hired its first employee in a state.Once the state accepts the date of coverage you cannot change to an earlier date without flat cancel and new policy number as new business for New York

__label__Package-General-Liability Team: A very good question has been presented to me by one of our superstar UTS and I need confirmation.In my e-mail below from back in October, I suggested that on accounts where we were using MFG GLEEs on Financial Institution accounts in NY State (I can explain), that we would need to let the client know that we would be adding the FI GLEE and removing the MFG GLEE. Christine's question is whether or not we even need to send a separate notice for this since this situation is embedded in the master conditional renewal notices sent by Home Office.Please let me know your thoughts. I appreciate your help in advance.
__label__Auto Field Resource Team Member:This is an account I was assigned as temporary UT.  I am confused about two different things on this policy.There is a $10,000 Liability PD deductible on this policy.  When I look at worksheets I see a $10,000 deductible line for Hired auto.  The scheduled vehicles say no deducible on the worksheets. The 2nd item is the Hired auto.  There are several states on the policy.  The Hired Auto Comp premium is assigned to CA.  UM in  IL .  Liability in MT.  I don't see Collision assigned.  This has been a problem for me on a previous account.  I attached the resolution information from that above.Thank you for your assistance with this.  I hate to mess up an account which is going to be someone else's problem in the future.

__label__Auto Mike,I have not received a written argument other than demands to explain why we are removing the form.  On the three occasions that I have had the question, I have provided a detailed explanation that we are not reducing coverage if there are no scheduled autos anyway and the issue has generally gone away.  Of course these conversations take time, of which we have less and less to spare.On new business where the form is listed on the specs, refusing to add the form gives the optics that we are providing narrower coverage than our competitors.I guess the question remains, if even legal agrees that the presence of the form does not alter coverage on an HNO only policy, then why are we so adamant about removing it?    Conor Sweeney303-858-4115

__label__Package-General-Liability I tried to use the DMF attachment capability to attach an email I was sending to an agency.   I added DMF Attachment as a cc and made sure that the account number was the very first item in the subject line, and then sent my email.  When the agency responded to my email (which continued to have DMF as a cc), their email system added RE before the account #... (as does ours)   When they sent their response, our DMF system notified the agent that the Account does not exist  because the account # was no longer the first item in the subject line...  (Please see below...) Not sure if I am the only one doing this (probably...) but if this hasn't come up, I wanted you to know about it.  One person in our office figured out how to circumvent this, by putting DMF Attachment in the BCC section of the email instead.

__label__Package-Property We have an insured that was acquired by another Insured that we also write, out of a different branch, for a different agent.The acquiring company's CFO has elected to keep both agents happy as both accounts are 7 year customers to CNA. He is electing to keep both agents happy, and keeping the acquiring company under a separate policy, while keeping the acquired company separate as well.We were advised by our agent (acquired company) that the CFO has reiterated they can keep their policy with us, with a name change and is agreeable to keeping an Other insurance exclusion and a Designated locations/premises exclusion so he cannot recover under both policies, but only the appropriate policy that responds to those specific hazards. There is a severability of interest clause under the GL form. Our intent is not to provide duplicate coverage, but a carve out. One umbrella policy will sit above both, scheduling both policy numbers. Is this structure possible and doable? Or does the acquisition lead to only one true new policy for both? Our agent is in danger of the losing their business, which we understand but would like to explore all options as requested by the client directly. If only one policy can remain after the merger, we'd like to know so we can cancel our policies accordingly and correspond with our agent. Thanks!

I received the bind order and sent it to be issued and received an email from the assigned psr, saying the WC premium was now $19,011 (an additional $501). The exp mod is the same. The payroll is the same. I went to research the difference from the quoted premium to the new premium. The premium difference is coming from DE & DC (expense constant). It wasn't on the quote when sent to agent. Why is it on there now? I opened an incident yesterday. I've been seeing this a lot in the past month.

__label__Auto ​I am attempting to confirm that the GL rate change calculation is correct and if so hoping you can help with some clarification on how the rate change is determined for RST purposes so I can match up accordingly in my renewal planning. More specifically if I carry forward the expiring rates and adjust for the updated exposure basis I return a positive rate: a projected annual GL premium of $23,454.06 carrying forward prior rate and adjusted for exposure difference compared to an actual new GL premium of $26,052.74 +11% premium difference when adjust for exposure change but RST is representing a -.02 rate. Any assistance/guidance you can provide is appreciated.

__label__Package-Property ​I have a question for rating and underwriting purposes for how EQ applies as TAP is very confusing on what it allows us to do and also the end result/intent of coverage we want to provide. If Earthquake is rated ALL Occurrence Agg/Occ limit $25mm and All Occurrence Yes. All locations with EQ coverage are included within that limit and subject to the occurrence deductible selected. What limit is applicable at each location? The TIV at each location? If I add 1 location that needs a different deductible., say California then it is necessary to change this to all occurrence No. In this case I then have to enter a sublimit at each location in TAP. What limit should be entered in the TAP screen. The TIV at that location? The occurrence limit applicable to that location. If I enter a limit higher than the TIV will there be a greater limit in the event of an earthquake? I someone can explain this to me, I would really appreciate it.
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Hi - I will be working in this file for a few more hours, however, I want to bring to your attention the fact that this law firm, for the GL, we went from a rating base of square feet to a new rating base (PGL) that is number of attorneys.  Even though the GL premium is relatively unchanged from last year, the GL rate is showing a -78%, which will reflect negatively on me for this account.  Please fix...  Thanks, Barry

__label__Umbrella ​Team, Our insured received an endorsement bill charging $1,010 to increase the umbrella limit from $1M to $2M mid-term. The policy is effective 6/24/2017-6/24/2018. The endorsement was requested effective 3/9/2018. It looks as though they were charged the annual premium to increase the umbrella limits, instead of a pro-rated amount for making this change mid-term. I have attached the corresponding email chain between the UW and the agent, along with the endorsement the agent received. Can you please advise if we can pro-rate the umbrella premium? And if so, what steps need to be taken to correct this endorsement charge?  
__label__Package-Property Hello,I have an endorsement that appears to have been processed correctly in TAP (changing BLD/BPP limits at a location.) However, the printed endorsement to the agent reads poorly, actually incorrectly… stating the location now has NO coverage except the default $100,000 extra expense coverage. From my past experience this is probably an IT/print issue? Can this be fixed?If not what is the current strategy to fix this problem? This causes an exorbitant amount of wasted time between the agency, processing, and underwriting departments trying to uncover the problem and then explain to the agent that it actually was processed correctly even though the endorsement print shows zero proof of that. Please help J

Deletion of forms and endorsements and I don't (see page 8 of 8 on the attached proof copy of the endorsement) I will hold off on issuing this endorsement until I hear back from the Field Resource Center  
__label__Umbrella ​Current options that I'm aware of to achieve this include: 1-Use a pro-rata wheel to estimate the additional premium. I personally do not like this method as I've yet to be able to match what EPC comes up with. If it were a dollar or two off no big deal, but it is usually more than that which can create problems. 2-Perform a cancel rewrite. Extend the expiration date of the rewrite, quote, advise the agent of AP. This is simple and accurate, however it causes other problems. Potentially big problems, as follows: Canceling the policy. This cancels the current active policy in the system and creates an RP for accounting. Money cannot be reapplied until the rewritten policy is issued. Which brings up my next point… In Monoline Umbrella, our policy cannot be issued until we receive the underlying policies and or policy extensions. This can take a good 30 days or more. In the meantime, we have money sitting in limbo, that cannot be applied. There is no option to book a cancel/rewrite. We can only issue it. This is further complicated when the policy is on Direct Bill. Money is typically held (per the person I spoke to in Accounting) for 30 days before being returned, I assume to the insured?  Is there another way I am unaware of to quote a policy extension? I've tried copying the number to a new term (current effective date with extended expiration date), but the system does not allow for same policy types on the same account with overlapping coverage dates. Perhaps someone can look into this and advise a solution? Thanks,Carole

__label__Workers-Comp HelloI have a work comp policy I am working on.   This is a mid term add on work comp policy.   Dates will be 8/7/18 – 3/31/19. (to match up with rest of policy)When I went in to review the quote, I noticed the eff dates were wrong and were listed from 8/7/18 – 8/7/19.  I noticed the premium for the annual term was $346.  I updated the eff date to 8/7/18 – 3/31/19 and then noticed the premium to up to $519. In reviewing the quotes, there is a Required to Balance Minimum Premium in PA for $302 on the short term policy.    On the annual policy there is none, but it doesn't make sense to me because the premium difference from annual to short term is only $7.   ($12 to $19)  So why wouldn't the annual term need a required to balance Min Premium adjustment as well?I noticed the opposite on the WV code.   On the short term policy, there is no Required to Balance Min Premium, but on the Annual term there is?  Can you take at each quote and tell me why this is happening?

__label__Auto Due to the difference between Tap and EPC when applying schedule/debit mods, I have some questions about the worksheets. Tap – sch/debit mods were applied on a policy level and then could be modified by specific vehicles or common coverages.  So if I had a policy with vehicles in Illinois and Wisconsin and applied a mod on coverage part document it would go against all vehicles and common coverages. EPC – mod's added by state.  The example I would like you to take a look at is Bua6020499470.  A 15% schedule credit was added by the UW to Illinois but no other states.   When you set up the schedule worksheet for Il, the following states are also are also filed for the same credit/debit and risk characteristics – AZ, ID,  In,KY, ME, MD, MN, MT, NV, NH, NC, PA, RI, WV, WI and Wy.    Several of those states are also on the policy but no credit was applied.   To take it a step further,we could apply a .90 to AZ and then would need to set up another of the same schedule worksheet for this state but nothing would designate which state hadwhat.  I know this sounds like extreme knit picking but there is so much due diligence around schedule worksheets that I want to make sure I have a clearunderstanding.Thanks 
__label__Auto ​Hello FRC Team, I was working on the Auto policy for EPC on this account and noticed something strange.  The agent asked to see if going to $2,500 deductibles from the $2,000 deductibles originally requested would result in a notable premium decrease.  When I rated this up to quote this option however, my premium goes from $51,776 to $53,701.  Can someone help me explain why the premium is actually increasing, as they increase their deductibles?  It seems a little backwards to me.  Utilizing policy # 6072848430 as an example but am unsure if this would apply to all policies. Thanks,

Would this be something that would be taken care of automatically when the policy get issued or will something else need to be done on our end?----------------------------------------------------------------One item that CBIZ requested (not sure if you can help with this or not), but wanted to address prior to issuance:CBIZ needs CNA to proactively notify those states that require proof of financial responsibility.   I have attached 2 e-mails that show the process they went through with the Hartford.  They brought this up as CNA failed to do so when a piece of their program was insured by CNA in the past and one of their drivers was arrested and another vehicle was impounded.  Do you have any insight on who to contact to be sure this gets correctly handled the first time around?    
__label__Workers-Comp ​I wanted to bring this to your attention because I think they may start being an issue.  For some reason if we have several states on a WC policy but only have a WI Exp Mod the mod is getting added to all states.  This is creating a  blocking issuance status because the system wants the intrastate ID's for those states.    I have had 2 policies come back and this was the issue.    I didn't realize this was happening so wasn't checking for it. Then the exp mod has to be removed from those states therefore changing the premium so the quotes went out with incorrect premium.     One of the accounts is Pesi, Inc. Account # 3031838621.  I checked last years policy and all the states were the same and the exp mod was only on the WI exposure so I am wondering how the exp mod is getting added to all the states.  Is the system generating it or are the PSR's adding it?  I feel this needs to be brought to someone's attention.  As I indicated this is the second one I have had in a matter of days. The other is American Test Center, Inc.  Account #3020821182…same as above with this account.

Currently we are communicating in training that it is OK for users to choose either option / whatever they would do in their current systems today. Do you see any issues with this?Please let us know—thanks!

__label__Monoline ​Hi, 1, The quote/binder is not attached – please attach and sent back to the mail box2.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​ Can you tell me why the GL is showing a -3% rate?  Manual calculation shows we are getting about a 33% rate increase over expiring.  This is very confusing as UW's and brokers work off blended rate not based on rates per location.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​GL is actually a rate increase of almost 10%.  The exposures include NY and in looking at the rate comparison it is not reflecting last year's exposures for NY (presuming it is because NY was not on PGL last year but all other states were).  So system is comparing inaccurate revenue exposure.  Last year's total exposure was $986,662,618.  This year is $992,651,633.  Exposure change of +.6%.  Premium went from $425,855 last year to $469,894 this year.  Please have rate result corrected.

__label__Package-General-Liability Our valued customer was awarded a job to build a marijuana facility in the State of Ohio. Please review their legal  counsels concerns regarding their insurance contract and carrier from both a CNA  GL/Umbrella  casualty prospective and the Inland marine builders risk angle, and let me know if their concerns are warranted. Your prompt review and response would be greatly appreciated. Thank you,Karen  Hi Jeff, Great speaking with you yesterday. In follow up to our conversation, I looked into the status of medical marijuana regulations in North Carolina. There is legislation pending, but it looks unlikely to pass this year. Despite that, given that the operations in question are in Ohio, we do not see a high risk of enforcement proceedings by either the federal government or the North Carolina government related to your operations in Ohio constructing a medical marijuana grow facility.  As we discussed, marijuana is still a controlled substance at the federal level and illegal under federal law. However, since 2014, Congress has passed an annual rider that calls for no money to be spent on prosecuting marijuana use so long as the people involved are in compliance with state laws. It is my expectation that this rider will continue to be passed on an annual basis and that the risk of federal action against Welty would be relatively low.  After some discussion with a colleague, we flagged two additional issues that may arise from the project: Does Welty have any federal contracts? If so, there may be a risk associated with being in the marijuana space due to the federal prohibition; state legalization would not prevent the cancellation of those federal contracts for a violation of federal lawThere is almost certainly an exclusion in your insurance coverage relating to violations of law. Because marijuana is illegal at the federal level, in several states, insurers have denied claims relating to damage from medical marijuana ventures. There are a number of marijuana specific insurers, however. We recommend either binding an umbrella policy with a cannabis-friendly insurer to cover you in the event that your carrier refuses coverage or bind the builder's risk policy with a different insurer than you normally would and disclose the cannabis-related nature of the project to prevent a later denial of coverage. Lastly, you can reach out to your current insurer to see what their position is on cannabis-related claims; however, this may have unintended consequences of higher premiums or cancellation of coverage depending on their position regarding cannabis's legality. For example, if your policy was underwritten by Lloyd's of London, they are specifically not covering anything relating to medical marijuana.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Can you please assist with this request.  I contacted agency bill and unfortunately this is not something that they would be able to provide. Any luck finding out what the earned premium for the short period would be? Our accounting department can't reconcile on our end without a document showing the amount of cancellation and/or earned premium. The summary that Mark put together only shows the full amount (24,644) for the cancellation, not the earned amount from 4/17 to 6/21.

__label__Workers-Comp ​HI  RachaelAs a courtesy to you I reviewed your issuance and endorsements to assist in resolving the letter to the insured for a lapse in coverage. When I reviewed the policy in NCCI and New York's proof of web site  The insured Innosight Consulting LLC FEIN 04-3497520 showed it had been added and deleted from the policy . To prevent a flat cancel and rewriting the policy under a new number we manipulated the system by having the endorsement processed which reinstated the 10/25/17 addition of the name. Sometime we are able to trick the system into a fix.The policy now shows proof of coverage in NCCI  10/25/17 and in the New York proof of coverage web site.The term 04/24/17-18 is expired and will be audited. If  no other changes are made to the policy term 04/24/17, the dates will stick and there should be no other fine letters to the insured for the name Innosight Consulting LLC FEIN 04-3497520 as it is correct in the NY web. Pictures today of the NCCI and NY proof of coverage web sites. 
__label__Auto ​We are expiring an issue for a renewal (listed in subject above) in RST vs. expiring for the auto. The price per vehicle has increase greatly, bringing the premium with a flat rate change to $44K vs. $20K Expiring. The fleet has changed by +9 vehicles but it would not justify this much of a premium change.After doing some research we determined the cause might be from the secondary class codes used last year (in tap) vs. this year. Last year all vehicles ended in 15, from what we understand that secondary can now only be used in the state of MA. The current secondary class code is instead 99 (All Other) which we are assuming is the cause of the premium increase.Could you please look into the account and let us know if there is a way to utilize the same or similar secondary code as LY, or if you would be able to provide a rate override on the backend to allow us to get a proper quote out to the agent. The renewal date is 10/15 so we need to act as soon as possible, if you could please provide an answer today so we can provide the agent a revised quote by end of day.Please reach out if you have any questions Andrew, and let me know if I can provide any additional information

The agent below is attempting to extend their policies by 30 days to have sufficient time to work with the insured. The policies in question are BUA, PMT, and CUE. I don't believe a short term policy per expiring exposures would suffice because of minimum premiums on the umbrella.I've asked around the office, and many have advised a cancel/rewrite is needed to process an extension. If there are any premium bearing midterm endorsements, this would also complicate the cancel/rewrite extension.

__label__Umbrella ​I have another Riddle Me This question for you.  This pertains to multiple accounts – all related. Normally after a policy is issued we don't endorse the umbrella policy mid-term for any Auto or GL changes; and just settle up next renewal.  The three related entities all had auto and general liability endorsements after the umbrella was quoted and issued and WWO requoted the umbrella.  Is this a new change that we're doing going forward?Thanks.
__label__Workers-Comp ​Hi Andrew, Since you'd been able to assist on the previous, I am hoping you can help me with this one, especially since it's so time sensitive. The above account's WC policy is showing that there is only a .8% rate increase in RST, but when I'm doing my math on the side, it looks closer to 10% including the emod shift. Could you please look into what may be going on? I want to make sure the rate is generating accurately for that line since I need to send out my quote today, and the broker has been pushing back saying that the rate increase is much higher. Thank you for your help!

This factor should get applied to the Internal, External and Named Storm premium calculations.I would call this into the Field Resource Center and see if they can investigate this further. Perhaps there is a problem in the algo in that this factor is not being applied correctly. 
__label__Auto ​The above policy number is a 10/14/2018 BUA renewal which was issued in EPC.  The agent is questioning the fact that the renewal doesn't reflect the $10,000 Accidental Death Benefit Limit on PA Added or Combination First Party Benefits Form CA2238. The policy was rated for Basic FPB and also $100,000 Combination FPB as per expiring which is correct.  I believe the Combination Limit automatically includes the $2,500 Funeral Expense and $10,000 Added Death Benefit which was shown on the expiring term form CA2238.  However, on the renewal only the $2,500 Funeral Expense Benefit limit printed on the CA2238 and not the $10,000 Added Death Limit as was shown last year. I believe the renewal is rated correctly so this is more than likely a print problem with EPC.  Please review and advise if this is a known print issue or if there is something we can do to force the limit to print on that form.

__label__Workers-Comp ​FRC please provide assistance. See below. Please assist with directing this message to the department responsible for completing NCCI filings. It appears that we either made a mistake in filing the correction (in which case we need to have it fixed) or we followed what we were supposed to do (in which case I need information that I can share with the agent showing that we were just following the rules). 
__label__Auto ​Can you clarify for me what this fix will entail? - The fix, the form is now ADC including number of days.  Will it extend to all coverage lines or just BUA? BUA only  Will it allow the field to be able to modify the # of days on the form itself without impacting what's on the policy info screen? - Yes, you will have the ability to fill in the # of days (and not pull days from the EPC screen) If there is any documentation on this can you share that with me also? – I do not have any documentation to provide, as usual it will be included in the release notes when the fix moves to production Copying Josh on this for awareness because this has been a pervasive issue that has contributed to a lot of broker & UW anxiety. EPC forces the field to have to adopt the same time period for notification of cancellation required by the state for Insureds as other entities such as 'Additional Interests'. This system limitation administers a pretty harsh blow to our ability to service the needs of our brokers/insureds. The notification requirements of a cancellation for Additional Interests can often vary from the State Cancellation Notification Requirements. I'm thinking if we want to enhance our customer service capabilities we should be able to accommodate these nuances for our customers and not force them to have to adjust to our system limitation. In regards to your comments on notification requirements for AI's, there will no longer be a system limitation. State Cancellation Statutes do not differentiate between Insureds and Additional Insureds i.e. they simply identify a number of days. I assume you are referring to notification requirements that an insured may have to contractually provide. With the fix going in for CNA72315 we now have the ability to specifically identify both the 3rd party requiring notice and the number of days being requested.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​FRC Team, Hoping I can get some help from you before reporting an incident to the IT team as I was hoping to quote soon (i.e. today, if possible). This account was BOR'd to another agency (James A Scott – 383-046341), and UWS is showing WC, BUA, PMT and CUE policies as rated. However, in RST, I am only seeing the WC policy rated and the PMT, BUA and CUE policies are still coding to the prior agent (Willis Towers Watson – 383-078214). When I go to Quote Selection in RST, the only policy with agency code 383-046341 is the WC. Is there a  workaround for this to get the other policies for 383-046341 to show up in RST? Thanks in advance!

__label__Auto Hello –I need some help regarding a possible contingent leasing exposure.I have a current policy called Pure Romance.  We only write the auto, property and work comp.  Basically this company has '1099' consultants who travel to different customer's homes and have parties for their products.  What is occurring is that Pure Romance has recently purchased 3 – 2018 Ford Transit Vans that are wrapped in the Pure Romance logo and they will be giving them to their top 3 consultants in a lease to buy program.   After reviewing E Library and silverplume, it appears that I need some type of Contingent Leasing coverage form on our policy for these 3 vehicles?    The producer stated that these 3 consultants will be responsible for carrying their own insurance as well.  There will be a lease agreement (I asked for a copy) in place.  Unfortunately with this type of lease to buy, the producer stated that there may be no stipulations in the lease agreement on who can drive the vehicle, personal use etc.  Am I correct in saying that I would need to add form CA 2009 onto the current auto policy?  Or is a separate policy needed?  When I pulled up the CA2009 it doesn't appear to have a fill in for the vehicle that would apply to this coverage?   Is there a limit that we will only go to with this request?   (not above $1M?)Resource library shows that it is a manual rating process, is there a guide on how this should be rated?Would this be the rating tool?  Would I consider a Ford Transit Van as a light truck and use the .62 loss cost?I'm looking for direction on this type of coverage and hoping that I am on the right track with the coverage I need.    I have never had something like this come up before, therefore I want to make sure it is done correctly.Thank you!

__label__Auto ​Hi Mike,I’m working a new business account (positioned to win it) and the below question came up regarding the auto deductible for scheduled vehicles. Do we have the ability to offer? I spoke with Alison & we both agreed we don’t think we can.The example he used was $130k scheduled auto gets in an accident, the policy responds full replacement cost minus a 3% replacement cost deductible. So in this case the deductible is $3,900.I’m going to upsell the fact we are providing a $1k deductible that won’t increase but just wanted to check we don’t have the ability to match that offering. Chubb is the current carrier.
__label__Workers-Comp ​Per the correspondence below… We have determined that an entity scheduled on an existing WC policy is not combinable with the First Named Insured.  Branch management is in agreement to write a separate policy for this entity and now I am trying to resolve the logistics involved.  Can someone inform me if that new policy can be setup under the existing account number? Thanks,Dan
__label__Package-Property ​The agent received the attached endorsement. The endorsement itself is correct, but the premium does not make any sense. It shows that there is a return premium of $55, but the insured owes $1. Please advise why this is.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Please see below observation on guidelines that seem to contradict one another regarding the rating basis under Rule 24.   Per Dieter's slides, the rule was amended in 2011 and we no longer need to use WW Sales for Premises. However, Chris Brutzman's guidelines from 2017 state that we do. Dieter's slides also show using form G300809 to limit the coverage territory on the Umbrella, which appears to be a retired form. There doesn't appear to be a corresponding CUE form, and I don't believe that this is built into the CUE (like the Pol Terr Amendment, formerly G115926, that is now built in). The only new form under the CUE is 76493 to Exclude Products. Please provide clarity on:Does MM need to rate for Global Sales on domestic Package? (attaching G145743)What is the correct form for the Umbrella, assuming it's not also sitting over the Foreign Package? Thank you,Marcy

__label__Auto My broker for AVIS has asked this question regarding MI PIP and how the MCCA reimbursement operates. The MCCA currently reimburses auto no-fault insurance companies for each Personal Injury Protection (PIP) medical claim paid in excess of a set amount. Currently that amount is $555,000. That means that the insurance company pays the entire claim, but is reimbursed by the MCCA for medical costs over $555,000.Is it safe to say that if a particular insured carries a $2M deductible that the insurance company would not reap any benefit from an MCCA reimbursement until after the PIP medicals exceed the $2M threshold?  It would seem that would be the case but want to make sure I'm not missing something here.

__label__Workers-Comp Hello all,The FSR department or the Crit Team does not file WC policies to provide proof of coverage or verify filing for proof of coverage.All Workers Compensation files electronically for all carriers through WCPOLS by issuance of the policy or endorsement. There is nothing that can be filed manually for Proof of coverage. NCCI and the states will only accept the electronic filing which is produced by issuance of the policy or endorsement. The electronic feed goes out in a batch to NCCI and the states in the evening. NCCI accepts or rejects the policy the next day. Independent  states have different schedules on when they accept the information usually 3-7 business days.Once the state accepts the date of coverage you cannot change to an earlier date without flat cancel and new policy number as new business for New YorkSince NY was issued effective mid-term and NY is looking for coverage effective inception, this policy will need to be cancelled flat and written to a new policy number as new business entered from scratch. It cannot be copied. Please review the below requirements for proof of coverage with policy issuance.What feeds electronically for proof of coverage?  If any of these items are incorrect on the issued policy the insured is uninsured.•           Name and legal entity –Must be an employing entity in the USA.•           Registered FEIN –Electronic filing for proof of coverage is by the FEIN number.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello, My questions is regarding Florida work comp rating. I have a Florida domiciled account that I'm working on. Based on the e-mod and class rate drop, the overall rate has decreased significantly. I'm trying to offset the decreases by changing to company and adding scheduled debit, but EPC does not provide for an option to add it, which is leads me to believe that we are not filed for scheduled debit in Florida.  I've asked around the office and they have advised that Florida does not provide an option in EPC but I just wanted to confirm for documentation purposes that there is no way for us to add scheduled debit to a Florida domiciled comp account.

__label__Package-General-Liability Question on adding the Alternate Employer Endorsement.We did get the request to include the AEE. Our insured (Raymond Consulting) has a contract with Teva Pharmaceutical to provide management consulting services only. For the contract they will have scheduled meetings, but employees of our insured will not have a workplace at their clients office. So they are not doing any work under supervision of Teva (no augmentation) but Teva is still contractually requiring to have the form added. Attached is the summary of contractual requirements. Kelly Services is the employment agency for Teva placing all temporary employees and providing Risk Management Service for Teva and not part of the contract between our insured and Teva.We pushed back because a Waiver of Subrogation would be sufficient in our opinion. However they are not able to get the contractual requirement removed. With not having augmentation or staffing I do not see any actual exposure. We are not in a State where a WOS is not possible so it could be used as an alternative.The question is if I am overlooking things and there is a real exposure we have to be aware of. Again, no augmentation or placement of employees, just consulting so having a meeting in their clients office to interview and present their reports.Also, what would the suggested description of the job be.

__label__Not-LOB-Specific ​Please read Dan's eMail below. Is this accurate? -----------------------------------------------------------Jason, Not sure if this feedback is better sent to the Field Resource Center or you, so let me know if I should send to FRC as well. When the processing team follows up with an agent for additional information pertaining to an endorsement, the email comes fromcnaprocessingteam@cna.com. However, this apparently is an undeliverable email address. The email below to Jenna Markham does not indicate any place to send the requested information, so the natural thing to do is reply to the email that was originally sent…which is undeliverable. Something that should be rather simple (adding a vehicle) then needs underwriting/UT involvement to get processed. My concern is this is causing unnecessary frustration with our agent's and their support staff, considering there is not more detailed instruction on where to send requested information to ensure the endorsement is processed. Thoughts?

__label__Package-Property ​Can you please offer some assistance in explaining why the premium changed for multiple locations when I only made a change to one location? The agent doesn't understand and neither do I where this additional premium is coming from.This is the standard explaination but the the u/w needs a simpler reason the premium changed for all locations . . .As part of PP3 updates the concept of group assignments was introduced for earthquake coverage. When locations are added to the policy with EQ coverage they are assigned to group A or group B. The total limit across all locations in each group is then used to determine EQ premium charged. When a location is deleted or added, the total limit amount for the applicable group will be changed therefore causing a premium change at locations that were not touched because they still depend on the amount associated with the group which has been changed.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Hi Everyone, I had a discussion with Kris Iannacone specific to Monoline Umbrella and the POR process.  I would like the FRC team to validate the below, but Kris is also looking for the most current POR process and associated EPC job aides assuming they exist.  Kris had shared that EPC has a Servicing Distributor Contact section which allows one to change the distributor code mid-term and will prompt the system to change the producer code automatically when the renewal generates 120 days out.  I was not aware of this function and neither were my UT's.  Kris will also gather some additional info on this function so I can share with all.  This will eliminate the need to go through additional steps such as creating an EPC Activity as validation that a new POR exists.  As an aside, changing the Servicing Distributor Contact will not modify where the policy output and billing statements are sent or agency information that generates on our DMF templates.  This only occurs to the policy once the actual producer code change is made to the pending renewal.  More to come!

__label__Auto So, working on a question and could use a neutral third party viewpoint, if you don't mind.  Base form CA0001 defines property damage to mean damage to or loss of use of tangible property.CA2114 10/13 – New Jersey Uninsured and Underinsured motorist coverage defines property damage as damage to a covered auto, or to any property of an insured while contained in a covered auto.  (Note Loss of use is not included in the definition)2 sides of the discussion.Named Insured does not purchase rental reimbursement coverage and does not have the BA Plus endorsement.  However, they are struck by a vehicle that would qualify as an uninsured motor vehicle.  The NJ coverage form allows for the insured to recoup property damage losses (less a deductible – Exclusion 7) when struck by a qualifying uninsured motor vehicle.Question is – Can the insured collect the rental reimbursement from the UNPD coverage?Answer 1.  Since loss of use is specifically absent from the property damage definition in the UNPD form it would not be recoverable.Answer 2.  Loss of use is not the same as rental reimbursement.  Additionally, the insuring agreement of the NJ form is that we will pay all sums the insured is legally entitled to recover… The damages must result from PD caused by an accident.  Rental reimbursement are damages caused by property damage and it is a measure of damages that is usually recoverable in a third party loss, therefore still recoverable under the UM form.Thoughts?

__label__Auto Team,Just trying to confirm.  For Florida autos where the insured has elected to have coverage for UM/UIM, is the following correct in terms of the printed policy or should the UIM premium also show as it does for AZ autos?
__label__Umbrella ​I have been struggling to get this CUE policy issued.   Initially we wanted to issue this as a short term policy 12/01/2017 to 01/01/2018 but the premium was not calculating correctly so then we decided to issue it as an annual policy then cancelling it after a month.   So, I first sent this into the Center to be issued on an annual 12-01-17 to 12-01-18 and the premium in RST is 47,586.  Which the expiring premium is only 5,086.  When you go into the actual Umbrella tab it is showing 4,040.    So then because this wasn't working the UW decided  to try and just do a cancel rewrite changing the dates from 12/01/16 to 01/01/2018.  So I sent this into the Center and now they are coming back telling me that the premium is now 51,627 –when the annual expiring is  5,086.   I am thinking this might be occurring because we already issued short term policies for the Auto, Pkg, and WC.   So I need help getting this done.   Ideally we would like to do the short term but I don't think we are going to get the premium to approximately $415 because I don't think this is how our system works.   If a short term can't be issued then a 12/01/2017 to 12/01/208 policy would be good with the 5,086 premium and then we would cancel it 01/01/2018.  If that can't be done then a cancel rewrite on the 12/01/2016 policy to make a long term policy from 12/01/2016 to 01/01/2018 with premium close to the 5,086.   Thanks for taking a look at this.  Hopefully I wasn't too confusing.  Thanks, Kelli

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello, I am working on the above captioned policy that we just BOR'd. As I work up the pricing on the account I do not know what my official rate change is because with a BOR you cannot utilize the same policy number. So, within RST there is no data for the above captioned policy number to compare to for the prior term since it is a brand new policy number. The old policy # was 6022866090. Before I quote the account, I just want to be sure I am not providing a rate to the broker that is out of line positively or negatively. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks,Sean

__label__Auto Team,Please see below.  We have a situation where a newly added driver was submitted and sent directly to the FSR department by the agent.  In general, no action is taken on mid-term drivers (i.e. MVR pull), but more concerning, if the request comes in directly to FSR from the agent, no notification is provided to the Underwriter or the UT.  If the Underwriter had the opportunity to review the driver being added mid-term, she would have most definitely excluded him due to his adverse driving history and risk to CNA. I would like to propose for the Underwriter or UT be notified if a request to add a driver is sent directly to the FSR or endorsement team by an outside source (the agent in this instance) in an effort to provide us the opportunity to pull an MVR and potentially exclude the driver if an adverse history exists.  Please review and advise.  Thanks!

__label__Auto I am reviewing UW guidelines for HNOA,  Under Terms & Conditions, it states Primary coverage is available for hired auto..

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Good Afternoon Karen/Team.. I believe this is one for your team. Below seems to be a summary of Stephanie's frustrations. I am not sure when this issue started for her, but clearly she is very frustrated with what she sees as a lack of communication back from IT on getting this issue addressed. Issue: .  Whenever she opens an endorsement referral, approve those items within her authority (corrections or otherwise), and hit the done button, the system is sending the task TO HER!!  She contends that these tasks should then be going to WWO Processing once she approves. Also Instead of it having a EMS Web link as when originally sent to the underwriter, it now presents her with an EMS Desktop Link, which does not allow her to open, re-assign, or process it.   My question for the team is this: (1) She had a role change from WWO to Branch Underwriting. Are there some authority changes that need to be made for maybe EPC or EMS to reflect the role change? (2) Is it possible that these endts are coming back to her because the system is still showing her role in WWO? In speaking with another UT and trying to understand the process, she hinted that the role change may have created some limitations or confusion with how these endts are being presented back to her. Please advise or point us in the right direction which will provide her with the ability to perform the tasks that she was previously allowed to do.  Any assistance that you all can provide would be great and please respond back using this email chain once the mystery has been resolved. Thanks

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Hey Chris,So I just wanted to forward this to you as this is the second one I encountered which this issue.  Attached above was a quote for new business by the underwriter.    The request was to include the epli coverage of $10,000 – which should just be automatically included for eligible SIC/Class codes.  However the quote is showing an ineligible SIC/Class code – 65121AJ – Condominium Unit Owner.  Per the job aid this would be part of condo associations under epli ineligible class codes.  The quote is showing that this coverage is included for the class code. the class code. My other example is under INC0593717, they got back to me as the underwriter told me we have to add this as the quote had the coverage, even though I told them I can't do it as the system won't let me add this so I referred this to help desk.  Help desk just referred me back to the epli job aid.  So I don't know if there's something wrong with the quotes as they are adding epli coverages on ineligible sic/class code.  Just forwarding as this is as this is the second new business endt with this error I rec'd.

However, when I look at the exposures and modifications they are very similar to expiring.

The WC was effective 2/13/2018-3/14/2018 (short-rated policy). This was done so it would align with the PMT policy (eff 3/14/2018-3/14/2019). Now we are wanting to bind coverage for the long-term WC policy (3/14/2018-3/18/2019) but an RST was not created for this line. I can't send for issuance without an RST being created. I remember you telling me that there is a way to create an RST so that the UW comments roll through to the new RST. I didn't want to mess up this account so I figured I should reach out to you for assistance to create the RST the correct way. Is this something you could help me with? I would appreciate it! Or, if you are not the person for this type of thing, please point me in the direction of who would be able to help me.

__label__Umbrella ​Good morning Rafael and FRC,We are trying to find the root cause for the mis-routing of 2 umbrella policies.  A Texas agent received these policies (policy numbers are below), but they should have been routed to a Chicago agency.  The systems have the accurate coding and, as Yolanda states, it's not an issuance error.  Can you help to identify the issue?

__label__Umbrella ​FYIIn Middle Market we have a few questions on when Reinsurance is purchased and how it is marked in EPC.We received some information from an Excess Umbrella Underwriter Jill Blasius (see below) and would like to verify if the same holds true for Middle Market.  On Umbrella for Middle Market would we have to change the PRPT code to 5848 when Fac Reinsurance is purchased? Is it required on the Policy Info screen in EPC that the Facultative Reinsurance be changed to Yes? On Auto would the PRPT codes have to be changed and if they do what would they be changed to? Can you please direct us to where in the Resource Library  the job aid for this can be found.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hi Team, I have a policy that is being held up at issuance over the Hawaii Tax ID Number. I have been provided the number by the agent but our system is saying the number is invalid. It states the number must be 10 digits long, but I found there was a recent change to the Hawaii tax ID number format which eliminated the 10 digit code. This has been held up for some time due to this so I was wondering if the systems were potentially not up to date to handle this request. Please see the link below for the information on the ID Number change. I have also included the Tax ID number that was sent to me. http://tax.hawaii.gov/geninfo/a2_b2_9tsm2/

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello Robyn, A policy number was not provided. If the endorsement did not transmit to NCCI and all of the requirements for proof of coverage have been met, then you will need to place a ticket with the Help Desk. What feeds electronically for proof of coverage?  If any of these items are incorrect on the issued policy the insured is uninsured. •           Name and legal entity –Must be an employing entity in the USA. •           Registered FEIN –Electronic filing for proof of coverage is by the FEIN number. Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number (EIN) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. A FEIN Number is registered for each named insured. Two named insured cannot share the same FEIN. •           Registered Unemployment number - ME,MN,NY,RI,UT.  HI requires a DOL# and NJ requires a NJTIN •           Class code, payroll. •           The information will only be fed to the state the Name is linked to on the policy. Each Named insured and FEIN, listed on the policy, must be linked to the state location or locations where it is registered to file proof of coverage. A name can be linked to multiple state locations. This information must match what the insured  registered with the State Labor Bureau and WC bureau or it will be rejected.

__label__Package-Property ​I want to talk with the property team on the issues that the UW raises on this large negative rate increase.  Can you help me get to the right people so I can set up a conference call.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tony, Situation below: At 10-1-18 renewal we were able to write the rest of this insureds property to go along with loc 1.  This consists of 15 mixed occupancy, mostly retail locations all sprinklered.  80-90% occupancy per agency....formal rent roll for these locations on the way. Location 1 is now partially occupied, rent roll in file for 2018 showing occupants of W. Kemper location (loc 1-1 to 1-7).  Couple of contracts also recently signed for rental agreements not shown on this rent roll per agt. Property renewal pricing shows a big decrease (27%), but this is not accurate due to last year we only had loc 1-1 rated as vacant bldg.  At renewal we added 15 sprinklered, occupied locations and now location 1-1 is partially occupied......the exposure change caused this large rate decrease to show even though deviation from manual went from .38 to .65.  Not an actual rate decrease. Account written at this pricing as accommodation due to insured's very large healthcare account we also write and wanted to get all lessors risk on this account and not just the partially vacant location 1-1.  Although  the rate decrease shown in RST is misleading, account still underpriced and need to bump up premiums over next couple years. No property loc. need referral or reins: 6600 Dixie High- $3.3 mil TIV- Const 3, hg 3, $15 mil retention 6560 Dixie High- $1.25 mil TIV- const 2, hg 3, $10 mil retention 6570 SOS- $2.5 mil TIV- const 1, hg 3, $10 mil retention 6679 Dixie High- $1.5 mil TIV- const 1, hg 3, $10 mil retention 6625 Dixie High- $2.3 mil TIV- const 3, hg 3, $15 mil retention 5951- Boy- $2.8 mil TIV- const 3, hg 3, $15 mil retention 84 Xenia Towne- $4.7 mil TIV- const 2, hg 3, $10 mil retention

__label__Workers-Comp ​Please helpThe attached policy shows a premium of  $7,015.  The attached endorsements are the only endorsements I show issued to the policy and they have an A/P of $15.  However they do not assign payroll.  To me it appears the insured has paid $7,015 + $15 or $7,030.  The attached Audit indicates the insured previously paid $6,882.

__label__Workers-Comp ​The agent received the attached endorsement that is charging $960 on the WC for moving payrolls from one location to another. Essentially, the insured moved from 1 location in Indiana to another location in Indiana. There were 2 endorsements processed for this request. The first one was not processed correctly and then the second is charging $960 AP.  I do not believe there should have been a change in premium since the rates themselves were not changing because we were not moving the exposures to a new state. Can you please look into this and tell me why we generated an additional premium charge? 
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Hi Karen: Good morning J    Hope your weekend was nice ! Just a quick question … I'm getting the Vista LRO set up for GL composite rate issuance today.   It grew from $22,0000 to about $169,000 … so big top line growth this year.  The GL Composite Rate Worksheet is completed and its all ready to go (attached above).  My question is:   If we add locations during the year, are the premiums (the AP due to the increase in Square Footage) only picked up at Audit or in real time as the locations are added during the year ?      In other words, is there a way we can charge the insured in real time (GL) as we add locations ?   Or only at audit if we composite rate the GL and issue as such ? Thanks !

__label__Package-General-Liability Hi. We found out too late that we weren't supposed to issued PGL Composite rated GL policies unless they're annual.This policy was issued from 2015-2017 as a 14 month policy.  The audit can't be processed because the auditors are pulling actual exposures but TAP keeps prorating the rate, not the payroll. Which wouldn't be a problem except that when I'm in TAP doing a correction re-issue, the system will show the correct rate I'm trying to get to, and then, when I issue, the system changes the rate. Please tell me what I need to do, exactly, step by step, to fix this so that the auditors can use the final rate mandated by the Underwriter and Agent to produce the correct premiums on this audit.The agent is very upset that this audit is still not processed and I can't find a way to make it come out right.  Your assistance in this matter is appreciated.

Since I'm unfamiliar, I thought you may be able to help. The insured reached out wondering in which states they need to file a DWC-1 form in the event of a claim. After some personal research, we found that TX, CA, KY, and FL require it. However, we wanted the full list of states that requires this first notice paperwork. Can you please advise? In addition, do you have the corresponding form by any chance or know how she could access it? Normally, I wouldn't try to rush this through. However, she's reached out to claims for this information for a few weeks now and hasn't received a phone call back. I tried looping her in with claims again this morning, but they forwarded her to RC without a call back number. Thanks!

__label__Package-Property ​-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi,Onetime fix is planned for 05/25. You will see the data reflected once the close is completed.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great memory.  We had this problem last year with NYS.  Sakthivel – Another Assumed Reinsurance policy, category code three, is showing incorrectly on the production report.  Please manually correct this policy to show as NEW business in Merlin.  Account Number is 0125979688, Policy Number is 6023354912, Effective 4-1-18.  Ticket number is: INC0575245 Field Resource Center – Can you get this fixed?  Last year we found:Not all Category code 3 are marked as 'X' in Merlin. There is a logic to look for supplemental data if the category code is 3. Based on which, it is categorized as New, Renewal or Other (X). (decode(substr(SPPLTL_DATA,79,1),'1','N','2','R','3','N','4','R','X')),'X') as NEW_RENEWAL_CD Merlin look for the 80th position in the supplemental data (SPPLTL_DATA) from the PES feed and determines the New/Renewal code. For this policy, there is no value in 80th position and it defaulted to 'X'. Hence Merlin is showing as X – other premium for this policy. In summary, Assumed Reinsurance New Business does not show in Merlin as new business.  TAP is not sending the required information to PES -> Merlin for LP and SRP Assumed Reinsurance policies.

__label__Auto Hi Mike – I have a question for you when it comes to MVRs and privacy.   I have an insured that runs their own MVRs for new employees and also run MVRs annually.   The agent is asking me that since we still run a sample of MVRs at renewal, if the employee would sign a document stating that we (CNA) are allowed to disclose the MVR information to our agent for that specific employee, is that allowed then? I know it is a silly question because if the employer is running the MVRs, I would think the employee could ask their employer, but this is something the agent wanted me to reach out on so I am.  Just trying to figure out if we have approval to disclose mvr info to the agent w/ a signed document from the employee, would it then be allowed? Thank you!
__label__Workers-Comp Hello, We issued the cancellation short-rate.  The agent is wanting to know what the return premium would have been if done pro-rata.Is there a way to manually figure that?  Or would it have to be re-cancelled as pro-rata, then re-done short-rate? 
__label__Not-LOB-Specific Can someone help me confirm how we determine who would be contacted at an incumbent agency with a notice like this one?  The incumbent agent is confused by our reasoning for the person we utilized to send notice and that is a reasonable confusion because that is not a person we typically interact with when dealing with this account. 
__label__Package-General-Liability Hello-Wondering if there is any way to figure out the amount for the pro-rata cancelation (due to an acquisition, we will be canceling the policy).Or must we have a signed LPR and then we can provide the amounts?Just want to make sure I'm not overlooking anything.Thanks,Melissa
__label__Package-General-Liability ​I'm not sure who to send this to see which of the two tools is correct.  RST is indicating we got a +7% pricing increase on the account and +2.4% increase on the GL.  BPMT is showing that we gave up -26.3% on the account and -50.2% on the GL.  Based on premiums, it appears RST is more accurate.  Why the disconnect?
__label__Auto Hi!  Please see the e-mail trail below…..do you guys know of any solutions?SandraP.S.  John Schramm sent it to Joyce Trimuel, Senior Vice President, Chief Operations and Diversity Officer who says she's engaged Kirsten Charlton, VP within WWO, as well.Hi John!  Thanks for offering to look into this issue the Agent has brought up.  See the highlighted portion below.  This is regarding Direct Bill.  When an endorsement is processed and it has an RP, CNA Billing allocates that RP to any LOB that has an outstanding balance.  This makes it difficult for the Insured to allocate on their end when they get our invoices.I spoke to Direct Bill and they tell me there is no way to flag the account to make it allocate only to the LOB on the endt.  The solution is to move that LOB to a separate Account Number (which makes us change the policy number, too) or move it to Agency Bill.Let me know if anyone offers another solution.

__label__Workers-Comp ​I just received a call from the agent and the Insured is very upset about these endt's. Insured states these should not apply as their executive officers are located in Texas, not in California, and payroll is listed on the Texas policy. To further complicate matters the insured and agent called the Ca Comp Bureau and the person on the line allegedly agreed that this shouldn't apply to them.Was AB2883 supposed to apply only to Ca based operations, or does the wording make it apply to every policy regardless?If it's all policies then aren't we double charging them for executive payroll for both states ? The Insureds contention is that if they are Texas employees then why are they even showing up under California payroll – there are no executive officers in Ca. ? Please advise how best to proceed. Thank you - RM

__label__Package-General-Liability Hello,I'd like to request help with a multi-faceted problem.  I believe this is partially an IT problem and partially an audit problem.We have completed an audit on the expiring term. The rates used on the audit are substantially incorrect. In catching this error, the agent and I also noticed that when we processed a mid-term endorsement to reduce exposures in this same term, the rates on the endorsement increased. These rate increases were not ordered mid-term by the UW.  It appears that before we can amend the audit, we have to figure out why the mid-term endorsement changed class rates.I would appreciate your assist in confirming what caused this problem and how to fix it.Thanks!
__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello Cindy, The FSR department does not file WC policies to provide proof of coverage or verify filing for proof of coverage. All Workers Compensation files electronically for all carriers through WCPOLS by issuance of the policy or endorsement.

You will want to verify the entity they are looking for coverage for, the dates the coverage is missing and then review the policy for any errors. Requirements for proof of coverage are below: Name, FEIN, and any state tax id must match what the insured uses to report payroll to the state.The name must be linked to the state locations they have payroll in on the EPC locations screen. 
__label__Auto Per below, this agent is requested we back-date to remove a totaled vehicle from coverage.  In the state of MA I know this requires a plate return receipt, but I'm not sure if that is true in ME as well.  I'm not sure how to find that answer and was hoping for some support.  Can someone advise how I should proceed on this request?  If these guidelines can be easily located I would appreciate a link to the info for future reference as well. Thanks!

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Please see attached worksheets for 2017 and 2018.   For 2018 the only GL class with exposure is 91585($6M) with a combined premises/ Prods rate of 19.33.   For 2017 the exposure for this class was  $64,972,890 and the combined rate was 2.936.    We are charging a much higher rate this year as the insured is in runoff mode, combined with some loss issues.   I believe the rate increase is legitimately 658%(19.33/2.936 x 100).  We want to make sure we get credit for this in our July rate numbers as it has a large effect on our rate achievement.   I understand why Merlin would thinks it is an anomaly, but it true rate.  Let me know if you have any questions.   Thanks.
__label__Package-General-Liability Hi Team:Marissa Santoro is in desperate need of getting access to risk control.  She has access to Sybase (which is what she was told she needed in order to access the Risk Control tab in UWS); however, she receives an error when she goes in to that tab.  She has set up two incidents with IT with unsuccessful resolutions.  Can you please have someone from your team intervene? 
__label__Package-General-Liability ​GL and UMB rate change looks incorrect. It currently shows a -13.5 rate decrease. Before an audit it showed +1.8. I will send the past dashboard to you in an email. I used the same company and used .09 more debit for the 18-19 term which should show a rate change much closer to flat or above flat. Please let me know if you have any questions.
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Please see below 2 examples of accounts that are showing as FT eligible that are not.
__label__Workers-Comp FRC Team – could you advise if we should amend 8810 for all states to 8820 for the 2018-19 renewal (issued 1/1/18), or should we just amend 8810 in TX to 8820? As you can see in the attached audit for the 2017-18 policy year, only 8810 in TX was amended to 8820. I'm thinking this is only applicable to TX, but want to make sure before going back to the agent. 
__label__Monoline ​Good day Please advise on the matter to amend a preformatted form G16675B to include special wording.I am under the impression that we don't amend any form to include or exclude coverage.The attach endorsement is for review. Please provide direction on the matter.  Thank you.
__label__Not-LOB-Specific Good morning, I have taken the 2018-2018 Data Privacy and Security Training in EPC and it will not let me evaluate it.  It still says 'Launch' – as in not completed. Can you help me figure out if this is an IT error?
__label__Not-LOB-Specific ​there is a Inland marine policy on this account. I did not include it under the quote selection. My account premium would be around $69,000. RST will not let do the fast track because it is including the premium from the IM.   Monoline marine does not care what the rest of the account premium is when they are developing there fast track (there premium should be under $15,000.)  Since I'm not incuding it under the quote selection then the system should allow me to do a fast track.
__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello, I have a general compliance question.  I just called the State Board of California and they informed me that it was okay to include California on an all states WC policy.  They sounded a little shaky though so I wanted to confirm this.  Can you point me in the right direction? The reason I am asking is because one of our insured's is getting hit with a debit audit in California because we have a separate WC policy for that state and it fell below the minimum premium for the state but the all states policy more than covers the minimum premium.  I'm trying to see if there is anything that we can do about this. Thanks!Sean
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Morning:   This policy has a residential Deductible.  The 2017 term has $25,000., residential deductible.   The 2018 term deductible needs to be changed to $50,000.  The residential deductible is not showing on the policy for both terms.   The first attachment is form # CNA 75119  Deductible Applicable to Damages Endorsements.  The form states that if there is a residential deductible than form CNA75120   is supposed to generate, and print the residential deductible.  The product catalog says CNA75120 is an auto generate if CNA75119 is generated.  Form # CNA75120 did not generate.  I need to add CNA 75120 to the 2017 term going back to inception. How do add the form to the expired policy?   The second attachment  is for the 2018 term.  The situation is the same as the 2017 except the forms are different.   Form # CNA 75119 says the residential deductible information is printed  on # CNA75121.  CNA75121 states the residential deductible information  is printed  on form CNA75122 (which did not generate).   The product catalog states CNA75122 auto generates with form CNA75121 when there is a residential deductible.  How do I get this form to generate to show the residential deductible?

__label__Package-Property ​Good afternoon – we are coming across a lot of accounts that a named insured has been added and then it changes the Policy Owner name in TAP and EPC.  I just received endorsement requests on two OCP policies where a Named Insured of P & H Realty was added to the PMT policy and it changed the named insured on the OCPs. Can you please check into this asap as I have to answer to these two EMS endorsements that I have to get this corrected.  The example is: D & G Contractors Inc. – acct. no. 0109531880 The OCP policy numbers are 6057108261 and 604037854.  The policy owner should read D & G Contractors Inc. Thank you –

__label__Auto ​We used to issue 2 policies for auto. 1 was MA auto only and rated/issued  in a legacy system, not in TAP; the second (BUA) was all other states and was rated & issued in TAP.The 2nd policy (BUA) did not have MA as the primary State. Only the Legacy Policy did.When TAP was programmed to process MA auto rating & issuance, the MA auto was combined into the BUA.Not sure if any of the BUA policies had the primary state amended from non-MA, to MA. If we change these BUA policies to show the correct primary state (MA), what effect will this have on our auto rate change figures?If we don't change these, what effect will this have on our book when actuaries look at the MA auto rates?

__label__Workers-Comp ​FRC Team – I believe all we would need to do to resolve this crit is add New York as a location to the WC policy with 'if any' for the payroll and 'no specific address' for the address. We would likely use 8742 for the payroll code (will confirm the nature of operations for the employee(s) who work in NY). Can you confirm?

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello-We received a cancellation from WI.. I know WI has different 'rules' for work comp.  However, we wrote this as NB.  Wisconsin is on our policy, with payroll reported.  Why is the insured getting a cancellation notice? Additionally, if the EE lived in another state, but worked in WI.. that payroll would be reported in WI and coverage would need to be in place for WI... correct?Let me know if you have any questions for me.Thank youMelissa

I am able to pull loss runs in CNA central via the first attachment, however, they are not in a format that's compatible with the system the agent is utilizing to upload the WC loss runs into.

__label__Auto ​Please review accuracy of Emods on BUA 6020313166 so we can quote todayI've been working on the pricing with the agent and that piece is all set to go.  The only thing I'm unsure of is the Auto e-mod.  We are not going to be able to get updated loss runs.  Auto wasn't addressed in the rater tech notes so I don't know if the emod is accurate.  I recently had an account where I couldn't get it issued after I bound it because the mods were screwed up so now I'm a little paranoid.  If you think we are ok with the mods then it's ok to quote.

__label__Package-General-Liability Good Morning,I was hoping you could help me regarding the GL coverage on the above policy, it appears that the GL price has almost tripled on the upcoming renewal(90,683 vs expiring 32,125).

Any information you could provide would be appreciated, please let me know if you have any additional questions
__label__Auto FRC Team,Are you aware of any workflow documents that show a matrix on how UM/UIM should be handled by UW/UTs?

__label__Umbrella ​Description:We are trying to issue a 14 month policy.  We processed a separate RST for this as the other policies were issued short term for 2 months.  The two month policy was rated in the system and quoted to the agent for $1,247.  It issued at $6,000.  That was cancelled so we are trying to extend the 2017 term.  We cannot rate in EPC as we are getting an RST error in EPC - Exception:  RST Premium Data is not available.  Please check that the correct policy is selected in RST and verify that it has been successfully rated.  If the problem persists, contact production support. Exception occurred at 9/19/18.  Stack trace available in server log file.
__label__Auto We have a question in the field regarding Forms Filing with the use of DMF.  For instance does the UT still need to complete the Auto Filing form in DMF and then attach it in a separate email to the FSR box or can they attach the form in DMF and include it in their issuance instructions to trigger the Forms Filing group to send out the forms attached in DMF (i.e. Form E and MCS90)? Please advise on what the current correct process is?Thanks.
__label__Umbrella Please see below.  For some reason the umbrella policy is coding to Mono Umbrella in Merlin when it is clearly coded to MM (correctly I may add) in both UWS and EPC.   Why is this happening and how can we get this correctly coded this week, before the June booking month ends?    I appreciate the assistance.

Is it possible to have this endorsement updated in 6/30 and earlier?  Example of what I mean:Allegiancy (6010494621) eff date 4/26/18 generates the old formEvangelical Community (6013761672) eff date 7/1/18 generates the new form. Any questions or concerns please let me know.

__label__Workers-Comp Hi All, Would you be able to assist with the following question from the agent involving WC and the changes that have been made. The attachments are endorsements received form the WC Department as well as communication from the agent. 
__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello Patti, The FSR department does not file proof of coverage, it is filed electronically with issuance of the policy or endorsement. You can verify NY has received Proof of Coverage on their website athttp://www.wcb.ny.gov/icpocinq/icpocdisclaimer.jsp For Vollers Inc, they have not had proof of coverage in NY since 7/1/2015 with their previous carrier. You will want to verify with the NY WC board the dates they are looking for coverage for the fines the insured is receiving and correct all the policy terms needed. Vollers Excavating & Construction, Inc is showing proof of coverage from 8/29/16 to present, so there is a lapse in coverage from 7/1/15 to 8/29/16.

__label__Package-General-Liability AUTO LOB PAGE:Based on new guidelines it would be helpful if the summary screen for Auto LOB provided the following information:- Cost of Hire Receipts- Employee Count for Non-owned Auto Rating- Garaging Location Splits by High vs Not HighThis information is only available right now but pulling up actual rating in EPC/TAP and compiling the data manually.PROPERTY LOB:On the Additional Coverage section is there a way to have either a column to compare rated limits vs standard limits for EX/SE. Or even better a way to highlight (bold/italics/highlight/color change) for limits that are different that what is automatically included.Build out a CAT Peril Section in RST to show Group Limits and indicate deductibles per occ/agg.Add Flood redefinition column in the MAP screen to quickly identify if strategy is being followed.GL LOB:Increase the number of lines that show for ELPsOutline additional section in the summary (kind of like on auto for BA+ and Pollution) for things like Electronic Data Liability, Blanket AI, Fellow Employee, Product Recall, etc.WC LOB:Increase the summary section for State and Class Code splits to show all classes/states with scrolling section for quicker summary of analysis.Also have if any classifications included in summary.Summary section for Schedule rating applied by state for documentation of schedule rating worksheet function. What would be even more helpful is an additional column by state vs state filing availbility.UMB:Not sure if possible but pull in HGs from UWS Hazard Grade to overly against used HGs.EACH LOB SUMMARY SECTION:Add the Highest HG to that summary section to remove need to reference multiple systems (UWS).DASHBOARD:Would be helpful if it showed the HGs by LOBWhen there are multiple GL policies (such as a Bank with a Foreclosure Policy) on the same account it would be helpful to have two GL rate calculations by policy and then a total GL to better analysis the exposure.
__label__Package-Property Hi Teresa,Forwarding your questions to the Field Resource Center.Good Morning Linda,I worked on this renewal acct. with Sarah Jones, but she is out of the office. WWO has additional questions in order to issue this large 4/1 renewal.We quoted the renewal including the Vacancy Permit Endt. Also agreed to remove the additional covered causes excluded for Sprinkler Leakage and VMM listed on the Vacancy Permit Endt.Sarah thought the rater could just de-select these exclusions in TAP. As per your rater's comments below, there is no option to do this and she thinks we will need a specific endt or instructions to process.Could you please advise how we can do this.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Good afternoon, Wondering if you can help me.  With CA, when there are excluded officers, an additional waiver form must also be on the policy.  If the waiver form is not received, are the officers still considered excluded or are they then considered included?  I know without the form we add premium exposure of $122,000.00 under class code 8810 per compliance. I am not sure if you can follow below but it seems to boil down to the officers needing to be excluded for the state of CA and taken off of the AOS.  Then in stating all of the officers need this waiver form the UW just wants them all now to be considered included and handle correcting this part later. I don't feel right on this and need help/assistance.

__label__Package-General-Liability Could I please get some assistance with the rate indications on the Auto and Property for this renewal? On Auto I think the GKLL coverage is driving the change.  We did not make any significant changes to the overall limit, but last year it was all (incorrectly) aggregated and assigned as a single limit rather than split out into individual location limits.  That said, I don't think this should read as an enormous rate decrease and I'm wondering if it is possible to override. Similarly, on the Property line this was priced to a flat renewal, but then the agent requested that we add BI coverage.  We did not change the pricing structure, simply added a new coverage.  I don't think this should show as a massive rate decrease either. Is there anything that can be done to make these end results present more reasonably?

__label__Package-Property Good Morning,I need some assistance on a print issue that doesn't seem to make any sense.  Account number 3026675692 has one line of business that is not available through the traditional Policy Inquiry function on CNA central.  To date, we have exhausted the support desk atsupportdesk@cnacentral.com. The information we have received doesn't make any sense and I need to take this issue further.For many years, we have written all lines of this account. This year, the PMT policy 6012360897 is not available to view or print in Policy Inquiry.  This year, the availability of this line of business is not found as displayed below.We have followed the instructions provided by CNA Central support and we do not understand why this policy is singled out. The notes below mention something of small business, this is not a small business account.  Possibly this is where the error lies. The screen print below from Electronic Document Delivery lists this LOB as CNP which is traditionally a small business product. We would appreciate a resolution that restores the PMT policy line to be displayed under Policy Inquiry with the other companion policies.

On 03/16/2018 two endorsements were processed One effective 03/08/2018 and the other effective 12/07/2017. The exclusion was issued on the 03/16 date and payroll was increased by about 30k on the 12/07 date. Is the extra 30k in payroll just the pro-rated amount from 12/07/17 to 03/08/2018 due to us not having the exclusion form prior? Al.M

__label__Auto I am working on the above prospect with my CIL Anne McCrary and wanted to check with you while she is out of the office about this Motor Cargo policy.  The risk is a manufacturer of metal pre-fab buildings with MFG locations in CO, SC and ND. They do perform delivery of some of their products but  also will hire common/contract carriers.  All lines incl WC are written with TRV.The auto loss history has been very favorable (10 yrs attached) and I learned that TRV has 2 separate auto policies.One standard auto policy (light/medium trucks used for errands and local transport) and a secondary motor carrier liability (policy dec attached) with auto symbols 61 LIA and 67 for PD (9 power units).In my opinion, auto liability for the MC policy should be 67,68,69 so that we do not pick any additional exposures under the standard auto policy. The risk has a satisfactory safer score 12.5% which is below the 20.7% average.I believe the incumbent has a separate MC policy so they can price this exposure adequately vs the standard policy and also they may not include this policy under the umbrella.We will be doing RC survey soon and will address controls for use contract/common carriers but wanted to make sure I am not missing anything else on this exposure. Are we ok rating this as a separate auto policy?Let me know your thoughts!
__label__Umbrella ​Hi Team, On the Umbrella policy we have the boat exclusion exception that reads as follows: ii. watercraft the Named Insured does not own that is: a)      Less than 55 feet long;and b)      Not being used to carry persons or property for a charge;... Our insured is chartering a boat – 45 feet long – for a team building fishing trip.  There are only 4 employees going.    The question is: is a chartered boat a boat that is being used to carry persons for a charge?

__label__Workers-Comp ​WC#6042830976 Good morning. With regards to the above WC renewal, additional information is needed for issuance. The state of MO is on this policy with payroll; however, the only information in the system regarding MO compliance indicates that compliance was not met and that the agent is not licensed in MOD. (see screen shot below). I was not able to locate any updated information in DMF. We are not able to issue the policy with the state of MO on it unless the agent is licensed in MO (and the rest of MO compliance has been met/proof obtained). Please provide proof of MO compliance accordingly. The only way to proceed with issuance for premium close without this information is to remove MO from the policy until proof is obtained, at which point it can be added back on via endorsement. Please advise. Additionally, we are missing specific location addresses for MT, SC, and TX. If valid location addresses are obtained for these states, please have the policy updated via endorsement as addresses are required for these states when applicable. In the meantime we are issuing w/ NSL per EPC. Finally, please be advised that the FEIN listed for the ANI is the same as the Primary Insured. This does not meet proof of coverage requirements, and any entity without its own unique FEIN is rejected for coverage. We are issuing with the duplicate entry per EPC in light of premium close, but once the valid FEIN is obtained the policy will need updated via endorsement (if the ANI does not have its own FEIN, it is not considered a covered insured for WC and can be removed from the policy)

We're likely going to endorse payrolls back to our original renewal payrolls for the 2018 term but I wanted to check and see if there was a reason or impetus behind re-issuing the policy in the first place. I'm relatively new to CNA and new to this policy and can't seem to find anything which pushed us to process it this way. Any assistance you can provide would be very helpful. See below a response from WWO and the correspondence on my original question.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Hi, Per the screen shot below, it appears that the classification for vacant land has changed with the conversion to PGL. Unfortunately, this is causing RST to reflect a 30% + decrease when in reality the exposure hasn't changed and we are currently getting $500 more in premium for the upcoming renewal. I do not want it to reflect that way as this will cause a massive hit on my rate goals. Please advise:

And the 88301 form is not list on the forms list on the policy but does appear on the endorsement???? I am confused even though it worked out in my favor. Any explanation??

__label__Auto Hi Mike,We are working on the new workflows for EPC Auto and have a question pertaining to a rule we currently have in our TAP workflow. New Mexico UM Statutory Compliance requires coverage must be offered at policy (liability) limits. If UM limits request on application are not at policy (liability) limits:Rate policy at limit selected for NM UM on  the application; Copy the quote; Change policy and replace second digit (0) to Q (this will allow both quotes to feed to quote proposal letter but are distinct.

__label__Auto Mike / Brian,Based on ISO rule 110 Loss of Use Expenses  is coverage for expenses for which an insured becomes legally responsible to pay for loss of use of a vehicle rented or hired without a driver, under a written rental contract or agreement is provided at no additional charge at limits of $20 per day/$600 maximum.  Endorsement CA 99 90 is amending Section III – Phys Damage paragraph A.4.b.Currently there are roughly 73 policies in the book (66 are Small Business) that are converting without Loss of Use coverage, with no UWI to the user, due to  the dependency rule in EPC  - Loss of Use coverage is only available if there is Hired Auto Phys Damage coverage on the policy.   The policy has Hired Auto liability, but no Hired Auto physical damage. We currently do not have UWI for this coverage.  If you agree the coverage should be dropped, we'll need to add the UWI.If we drop the coverage is a CRN required for these policies? Please let us know how we should proceed.

__label__Workers-Comp Hello Janice,The FSR department/crit team does not file WC policies to provide proof of coverage or verify filing for proof of coverage. If you receive this type of fine letter from an agent/insured please review the policy, link the names to the proper states, correct any incorrect Name, FEIN or UI # and issue the endorsement to file the proof of coverage with the state. Please see the attached Proof of Coverage document.The only insured that has proof of coverage for WC on this policy is the primary named insured. The 3 additional named insureds do not have any proof of coverage in any state at this time.All Workers Compensation files electronically for all carriers through WCPOLS by issuance of the policy or endorsement.NCCI and the states will only accept the electronic filing which is produced by issuance of the policy or endorsement.The electronic feed goes out in a batch to NCCI and the states in the evening. NCCI accepts or rejects the policy the next day.Independent  states have different schedules on when they accept the information usually 3-7 business days.What feeds electronically for proof of coverage?  If any of these items are incorrect on the issued policy the insured is uninsured.•           Name and legal entity –Must be an employing entity in the USA.•           Registered FEIN –Electronic filing for proof of coverage is by the FEIN number. Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number (EIN) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. A FEIN Number is registered for each named insured. Two named insured cannot share the same FEIN.•           Registered Unemployment number - ME,MN,NY,RI,UT.  HI requires a DOL# and NJ requires a NJTIN•           Class code, payroll.•          The information will only be fed to the state the Name is linked to on the policy. Each Named insured and FEIN, listed on the policy, must be linked to the state location or locations where it is registered to file proof of coverage. A name can be linked to multiple state locations. This information must match what the insured  registered with the State Labor Bureau and WC bureau or it will be rejected.

__label__Package-Property ​I need you to take a look at this one as RST is definitely wrong.  Our expiring prop exposure was only $5K in BPP with a rate of 12.380 and a prop premium of $619.   We added a bldg. with a limit of $1,022,792 and the current prop premium is $2115.  The system is calculating -98.5% and showing the recalc premium as $127,241.    This is obviously wrong.   You can't apply the expiring contents rate to the new bldg. as the bldg. would have a totally different rate(as evidenced by the quoted premium).    This is totally messing up the rate in RST.   I appreciate you looking at this and giving me your thoughts.   Thanks..

__label__Package-General-Liability Hi, we have an odd situation here that appears to need Undw and Billing to help.

__label__Package-Property ​Hi All, By this email, I'd like to re-engage the Field Resource Center to help us navigate and correct these problems as we have not made much progress recently and this is an URGENT situation for the agent and insured. To quickly summarize: we have large disparities in rating adding the Flood hazard on this account (as well as system errors considering the size of the schedule).  The premium to add flood has bounced from approximately $6k to $22k and most recently $3k.  Rating SMEs and TAP experts have reviewed all of the rating pages and unfortunately the cause of the disparities has not been identified. The account renews in August, and we cannot assume that the current (lowest) premium is accurate when the renewal could rate up much higher.  Also, underwriting expects that a higher premium is more adequate for the exposure and has negotiated the previous quote with the agent (while waiving a portion of it).  Perhaps it would help to rate the renewal to identify any more clues as to the rating disparities?  Or would starting the transaction over allow us to achieve a more accurate quote? Please advise ASAP on the next steps available as we cannot move on without an accurate quote for the current term that we have confidence will carry forward to the renewal.  Thank you,

__label__Workers-Comp Hi Ernst,I'm looking at two different class codes that could be used for an exposure and wondering which one would be the most correct (to avoid issues at audit)The two codes are 8803 (surprise) and 37243724 ELECTRICAL APPARATUS INSTALLATION OR REPAIR & DRIVERS   (I believe this is being used for the and drivers exposure)The account has software engineers that are in vehicles driving around in teams that are using their laptops to check the signal of wireless networksDrive testing is a method of measuring and assessing the coverage, capacity and Quality of Service (QoS) of a mobile radio network.The technique consists of using a motor vehicle containing mobile radio network air interface measurement equipment that can detect and record a wide variety of the physical and virtual parameters of mobile cellular service in a given geographical area.By measuring what a wireless network subscriber would experience in any specific area, wireless carriers can make directed changes to their networks that provide better coverage and service to their customers.Drive testing[1] requires a mobile vehicle outfitted with drive testing measurement equipment. The equipment are usually highly specialized electronic devices that interface to OEM mobile handsets. This ensures measurements are realistic and comparable to actual user experiences.Since the two codes have vastly different base rates I wanted to see if you could help point me in the right direction. I'm leaning towards the 3724 being the correct code since the 8803 code stipulates that the work being completed is in an office atmosphere and not while driving around.I'm asking as using the 3724 would make us uncompetitive on an account I'm looking at, but if the 3724 is more correct then we would obviously have issues at audit if we issues with 8803Additionally, as we start to move towards the mobile companies upgrading to 5G networks these types of submissions will start to roll in more oftenThanks for your help - RM

Or only if flood coverage is added?Is it the responsibility of the UT or the rater to added a flood redefinition form on policies that do not include flood coverage if there are locations in FL or Tier 1 or 2? Also which form is to be added if rater responsibility 81069 or 81068?Is it the responsibility of the UT or the rater to review locations, and decide if form 81068 should be added to the policy for locations located in flood zones A/B/Shaded X/V, all FL locations or Tier 1 or 2 so not all policy locations are affected by the updated definition.It has been suggested that the rater review all locations and add form 81068 for all rated policies, in lieu of the form  81069.  Please advise Let me know if you have any questions or need additional information

__label__Auto ​Hey Mike, Question for you when you have the time … Many of our larger risks ask for the MCS-90 form.  These are private carriers but will cross state lines and operate larger commercial vehicles.  They don't necessarily haul hazmats but of course they have gas in their tanks or might haul other product used in their daily operations that might be considered a hazmat (degreasers, paints … whatever). So we are often asked to attach the MCS-90 – probably more as a catch-all request by the broker so as to have it on the policy just in case. But are we also required to file a BMC 91X with the FMCSA if we also issue an MCS-90?

__label__Auto Hi Team,I received this question from an agent and did not want to give inaccurate information from what I believe is to be true. I know that Liability is always excess but physical damage can be either. I am not seeing that physical damage is primary in the policy, but my question would revolve around how we would respond if a claim were to be denied?I left a voicemail for the agent asking in what capacity they were looking for primary coverage so I will update when I do find this out.Enjoy the weekend!

__label__Umbrella ​To the Field Resource Center – please see below question: Is there any way to distinguish CUE policies (monoline / supported) from EPC Retrieve Account Summary response?  KJF Response:  on the Policy Info screen, you'll see it identified as either Middle Market or Monoline Umbrella. I have an account that has umbrella rated by the umbrella unit.  Is that premium included in the determination of an account being Fast Track eligible or not.  I believe this question was asked about the professional policies during the training but it was not asked about situations like this one. If it is not included in the determination of an account being Fast Track, my policy premium is under $75,000 but is showing as not eligible for Fast Track processing.  I deleted a line of coverage from RST, refreshed it and added the line back in but it is still showing not eligible with a $58,497 premium.  The umbrella premium for this account is $45,674. Acct #3000106630 – Presrite Corporation Eff. 09/10/2018 The person sitting next to me has a similar issue on one of her renewals.  Premium-wise it should qualify for fast track but it is showing it does not.  She also deleted a line of coverage and put it back in and it is still showing not eligible for fast track.   Acct #3031563657. I just want to make sure this is correct or if there is a problem. For Middle Market Fast Track accounts, do we include the premium for the Umbrella if it is written by the Monoline Umbrella Unit?  I wouldn't think so but want to confirm. Thanks!

__label__Auto Hello Mike,As we discussed a few weeks back, I am seeking approval to offer the following terms for the auto portion of the RIL Captive Program. There are no changes to the renewal template that was approved last year. The one issue I am hoping we can  revisit   (topic of our last meeting with Brian) is UM/UIM coverage. We had spoken about offering a limit of $1,000,000.  I reviewed with the captive program manager who discussed with the board members.  The program does not wish to increase the limit to $1,000,000.  They would prefer to keep the coverage as it has been.Since inception, UM/UIM has been offered for only those states that do not allow rejection.  As you  are aware, we had an issue with UM coverage and signed forms that came up just this year. One resolution that we (captive manager/me) discussed was having the individual brokers involved in managing UM (and PIP if applicable) exposure. We would like to advise at this renewal that we need UM/UIM (and PIP as well) applications completed on all accounts based upon the states where the insured has vehicles registered/garaged.  Also want to add that if at any time during the year, the risk acquires a new vehicle they would need to notify us and complete the necessary applications for UM/UIM/PIP (auto policies are composite rated).I am struggling with the covered auto symbol.  6 may be ok as we do have the potential to have exposure on a country wide basis.  Having the agent take responsibility in notifying us of changes and obtaining the forms, would help us in determining exposure – but there are still holes there.  Symbol 2  could probably result in the same.  So symbol 10 – say we have vehicles in garaged in MA (you can't reject UM).  We could define as all owned vehicles in MA.  However, if the insured does purchase and register vehicles in other states – may be a pain to keep endorsing the policies.  One off it would not be bad at all but there are 135 auto policies. The solution above regarding the UM forms was bounced around as the captive would prefer to use symbol 6.  I know this could be an administrative nightmare but until we are automated (yay EPC!) it may have to be done at this way for the 2018 renewal.I know you are swamped and I feel bad bothering you again on this topic.   If you would not mind sparing say 15 minutes tops (set your watch) tomorrow, it would be appreciated.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Hello FRC, In a team meeting today we had some questions that have come up regarding the completion of the Loss Run Summary in RST with New Business and whether or not input of this information impacts the model for all lines of business. Do we have to put in the previous policy number on each year? If this does impact the model and we do not have the previous policy number what should the UT's use?  If we do have the policy number and it is the same policy number year over year do we still have to enter for each year?Do we have to input the written premiums for each year?  If this does impact the model and we do not have the written premium what should the UT be inputting in that field? If these items do impact the model why are they not mandatory fields?

It needs to be redone as the deductibles are incorrect, but my questions for you are as follows: *Is this a new feature where we can now model exposures midterm in RST?*How can we confirm if RMS or AIR was used given the effective date of the policy?*how can I verify the model's accuracy? Thank you!

Now, I have to have NB set up image the other applications into their policy numbers so we are able to annotate the applications for rating. Or printing off the applications and manually mocking them up, then scan them into DMF. A lot of additional wasted time has occurred in doing all of the above and now having to wait until they are imaged in to complete the NBRI & finish annotating the rest of the applications.

__label__Package-General-Liability I have a question.  I have an account that is currently written with an agency eff. 12/18/17-12/17/18.  A new agency took over the account about a month ago.  The new agency has now instructed us that they want us to quote the renewal as of 10/01/2018.  We do not want to cancel the 17-18 policy term at this time because there could still be endorsements that would have to be processed  and we were not sure if that would create a lot of reinstate/recancel transactions to get them completed if we process this as a cancel rewrite.   We also do not want anything going out to the insured to indicate their current policy is cancelled.  They are taking the account to market and this is almost a half million dollar account. My question is this, is there a way to copy the current policies in EPC (the 12/31/18-19) term to the new term of 10/1/1810/01/19?  I know it is a long shot but I could not find anything.  Or, is there an way to start the cancel rewrite without completing the cancellation and still be able to start the rewrite? Thanks.
__label__Auto Hi Mike, I am trying to change the company code in EPC and for whatever reason I am unable to change it even when I click on edit policy transaction
__label__Package-General-Liability Hello,If the GL policy is composite rated do we still need to complete the worksheet?  I was told prior to this training that we are not required to perform this task on GL composite rated policies? However, we are required on Auto composite rated policies and I wanted to make sure that was correct too?  
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Took a call from Pat Quinn on this item.  I did not log this specific item into the tracker.  Karen will forward to the team – I'm notifying others in case we get other calls now.  There is a GL defect when experience rating is calculated.  Pat's example was a 5/31/18 renewal so not sure what went wrong on her policy as the error is for eff dates 8/1 and after.  Her policy number is #6018285755 and initially the Exp Rating was a .956, now it's ineligible, even after adding exposure.  Pat is in the Wyomissing office today – 610-320-4692.   Thanks
__label__Package-General-Liability ​GL showing -2.1% change in RST when the exposure and rate remain the same for this year's renewal comparing to last year. Please advise why GL is showing -2.1% at 2018 renewal?
__label__Package-Property ​I received the email below from my UW regarding the attached TAP Default Report (bottom of the email). She provided me with the changes that need to be made in order to correct the issues outlined in the report. Are we supposed to be making these changes via endorsement if the policy has been issued and is an active policy? Or is there another way to make the changes without generating an endorsement? Please advise the correct procedure.
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Hello –We have had a few accounts lately with RSU's.  The broker states that the other carriers are able to exclude the RSU's from the program.  We were under the impression that the treatment of RSU's varies by state.  Can you provide some clarity?  This account has a large amount of RSU's (see attached) and we will not be competitive if we have to include.

__label__Package-Property Good morning,I am accompanying Jessica Landau and an Underwriter on an agency visit tomorrow to discuss a couple high profile accounts and need to gain a better understanding on the reported unspecified locations coverage as part of the Paramount SE form and how it's applied when rating the policy.  Several accounts have excessive amount of locations (300+) and we feel we may benefit from capitalizing on this option.  Can someone experienced in this area give me a call today to discuss? I can be reached at610-964-5825.Thanks!
__label__Package-General-Liability ​I have rerated the GL several times.  I have waited the five minutes, and I checked the quote selection.  Can you clear the error?

__label__Auto Hello –Can someone explain the difference between Statutory and Supplemental UM/UIM coverage for NY.   It appears that the Statutory only has a very small limit that can be used and supplemental can go higher.  I just want to make sure I'm using the right coverage.  Resource Library didn't seem to have much info on this topic.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Can you please advise a resolution for this error in TAP?  The WC policy is rated in EPC, but errors out every time we try to pull that policy into a quote letter. 
__label__Package-General-Liability Hi,I don't see that this was completed. Deductible endorsements were added but they are blank.Thanks! 
__label__Package-General-Liability FRCI can't find this answer in resource library and was curious on CNA's stance.Do we need to write the GL in order to quote/write an OCP policy?Ex: CNA writes Prop/IM/Umbrella and the casually lines are in a captive program.  
__label__Package-Property ​Team, using this form … can we do these ?
__label__Auto ​I believe the Auto is causing the error.  I've gone into the Quote selection and unselected the policies, then went back in to add them back.  Error message is still populating.

__label__Package-General-Liability I have a quick question.I just noticed a few weeks ago that General Liability form CNA86269XX - Employee Benefits Liability - Amended Definition of Executive Officer Endorsement seems to be system generated on every renewal policy that has Employee Benefits Coverage.  Do you know if it is a reduction in coverage or just further definition. If it's a reduction I need to know so that I can include on our conditional notice.Thanks

__label__Package-General-Liability Hello FRC team,  can you help us in getting a copy of the 4/1/18 GL policy that has been issued, but no print job is showing up in UWS or EPC?  Thanks    
__label__Auto ​Hi, I have an account where the agent was wanting alternative options for higher deductibles on the auto. When we increased the auto PD deductible from $1000 to $2500, the premium somehow increased on the comp and collision on each vehicle, increasing the premium by over $1000 from the original quote. There was no E-mod or scheduled mod change, so I'm not sure what would've caused the increase. Is this in error?? Thanks,Kristen 
__label__Auto ​Hi Marsha, Per the EPC Team and Trainers it is the branches responsibility to complete the form if there are multiple deductibles on the policy. There are multiple deductibles on the policy for Zion BanCorporation. If you need instruction please reach out to the Field Resource Team for more instructions.

__label__Umbrella ​Hi There,Acct# 0124232023 I'm working on a key renewal that we bound 3/28/18. We write the Auto, GL, WC & Umbrella. The catch is that the Auto policy & loss sensitive WC was bound for the full annual term but due odd market circumstances – we had to bind the GL, Liquor liability and CUE policies on a short term 3/28/18 – 6/1/18. The RST premium for the Auto is correct at $88,359. It is the pro-rata premiums for the 65 day policies I am having trouble with. By my math, the below is what the premiums should be:GL: $18,404Umbrella: $10,960 Liqour Liability: $109 Can you help see if these numbers make sense? RST is showing incorrectly and so is UWS. I don't want to send an updated binder with incorrect premiums.
__label__Workers-Comp ​This endorsement was issued on the WC and the below part of the address was left off.  This was kicked back by the Cert holder wanting the complete address.  Would you please check to see if the issue is that there are not enough spaces on the form to show the 11th Floor on the form so that we can let the Cert Holder know.
__label__Package-General-Liability ​I'm sorry, but you're going to have to help me understand how 4 days after effective warrants the need to generate a catch-up bill.  It is the understanding of UW that if policies are issued by the 7th of the month, they will hit the current billing cycle. This policy clearly meets that criteria. Furthermore, if 4 days isn't enough time to every issue a bill for the down-payment portion only, then we need to stop advertising that we bill for the down payment. I have more understanding of this issue on a 12 month exception pay plan, but when we bill a down payment and have numerous months left in the in term for honor the 9 installments, this situation seems like poor service to the customer. My ask of the billing department at this moment is that you create a manual bill to the agent for the down payment portion only.  Then subsequent months to pick up the 9 installments as offered. I'm looping in the field resource center on this issue because this doesn't make sense to me. Field Resource Center: I need clarification as to how this can be avoided in the future. Issuing policies prior to the effective date is unlikely and nearly impossible in a new business situation. Thanks you,
__label__Package-General-Liability ​I went onto CNAcentral as you directed me to do. I corrected the sales for the CA location to show $7.4M in lieu of $10M. Why did the premium only go down $66? According to the CNA Notice of Conditional Renewal the premium for $7.4M in sales should be $14,543 (attached). Can you please research through this account and tell me why two Notice of Conditional Renewal  letters were issued? The one issued on 1/29/18 has the correct sales, its dated 4/8/18?? 
__label__Package-General-Liability This account has always had an other mod attached, in anticipation of NYS PGL approval.  Without the transition factor our math works out pretty well.  This is the first year for PGL on this account and the transition factor is huge at 5.682.  Without this factor, our GL premium would be where it needs to be without having to use the other mod.  Since the factor will eventually go away, we are hoping for an adjustment to 1.00 so that we do not need to use the other mod.  In any event we need to quote pretty close to expiring, and not go from a $27,000 GL to an $87,600 GL premium. ​

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hi Team: Attached are the most recent WC loss runs.  Losses Incurred2014-2015 = $2,893 incurred2015-2016 = $7,627 incurred2016-2017 = $33,140 incurred Premiums(I'm waiting for the final audits for 2014-2016 as we were not the broker then)2014-2015 approximate premium = $40K2015-2016 approximate premium = $60K2016-2017 audited premium = $103,172 The all-state mod went from .71 to 1.01.  The client is going to lose some major jobs and large clients due to the mod being over 1.00.  We need to try and get it under 1.00 if possible.  There was not a ton of premium, but I still don't see where the mod should be over 1.00 based on above.  Also, if the mod really has to go up, can it be specific to only Texas, as this is the state with the one larger claim during this time period.  Let us know what other information you need on our end.
__label__Package-General-Liability I have an 8/1/17 effective policy. I sent in a 2/22/18 endt to update exposures (ie payroll and sub costs). The math does not look write on this…did the system prorate the exposures somehow and not annualize the updated exposures sent in? The easiest way to tell there is an issue is to look at the sub costs that were issued with a $21MM CC with an associated premium of approx. $26K. When it was endorsed on 2/22/18 to change that to $0 CC the return premium was only approx. $9K…? Please help explain if this is a system error, endt processing error and can be fixed by just having endorsement processed back to inception date, or something else…thanks!(I have the same issue on the WC)

__label__Package-General-Liability I have realized that if an agent send in a new business submission directly to cinewbusiness set up, the actually email does not get logged in to DMF in EPC. All I can find is the application in imaging format. I think it will be great if the actual email request the agent sent in to get saved so we can review the attached documents in a more efficient manner. Besides, when UW refers account, we might need to forward the supplemental app only but everything is scanned in and the referral taken needs to go through every page for a specific information.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello Maida, When requesting an endorsement please be sure to specify the effective date to link the name to the location or you may have proof of coverage issues that will then require a cancel/re-write to a new policy number as new business if the effective date needs to be changed to an earlier date especially for NY. Names should always be linked effective inception or the date the name was added to the policy. The letter attached is regarding NY coverage, so linking the name to the LA location will not resolve this criticism. The name will need to be linked to a NY location effective inception with the NY Unemployment number. All Workers Compensation files electronically for all carriers through WCPOLS by issuance of the policy or endorsement. There is no manual filing. NCCI and the states will only accept the electronic filing which is produced by issuance of the policy or endorsement. The electronic feed goes out in a batch to NCCI and the states in the evening. NCCI accepts or rejects the policy the next day. Independent states have different schedules on when they accept the information usually 3-7 business days. Thank you,

__label__Package-General-Liability I have a couple of questions on forms that generated on a renewal quote.CNA86269 This endorsement amends the EBL forms definition of executive officer to remove the statement that they are not employeesCNA83894  This endorsement amends the Stop Gap Liability s definitions of definitions of Employee (with further criteria when leased workers are considered employees) and Executive Officer (removes the statement that they are not employees.Both of these forms are new this year.  Are these new Mandatory forms (both system generated) that need to be part of a policy when we have Stop Gap & Employee Benefits coverage?Thx
__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello Field Resource Center, The above policy recently had a 5% Construction Credit applied to NY per the WCRIB.  The application of this credit returned a premium of $688,142, which I do not feel is correct. The explanation noted below is what underwriting received and WWO notes that the endorsement was processed correctly.  I am baffled by this as a 5% credit should not return the majority of premium for NY – the total estimated standard premium was only $738,286 when the policy was issued.   There was only one other endorsement processed on this account with an additional premium of $44.00. I have tried to explain this to WWO but they are stating this is correct.

__label__Umbrella ​Recommendations for DMF1)    We often need to attach a copy of an e-mail that was sent to an agent to second request.  Often the UT is sending a copy of a document that was created by the Underwriter during follow-up.   DMF is returning an error indicating that this is an internal document and we can only send to a CNA employee.  Could you please present this dilemma to the team for a second look?   2)    We are receiving tasks for CUE UM formsafter the policies have been issued.  We need the task earlier in the process.  When the file is rolled over from expiring or when it is initially quoted OR we need to be able to create the Information Needed manually.  We are wasting valuable resources handling the file multiple times.  Thanks for your help. 
__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello, Why would the terrorism be so much higher than initially quoted?We made adjustments due to rate changes, but they decreased the premium slightly.

__label__Package-Property I'm sending under separate cover a correction to WWO; but I wanted to bring your attention to the fact that our property policies are NOT issuing correctly.  This is the fourth or fifth policy that we've had in the last month that isn't showing all the coverages.TAP shows the following:1-1$ 8,884,762 Building$   645,058 Personal Property$   450,000 BI/EE blanketed with 1-2 1-2$12,500,000 Building$    250,000 Personal Property$    450,000 BI/EE blanketed with 1-1 The Earthquake limits and deductible shown in the policy are correct. ============================The policy on the other hand has left off the business income/extra expense coverage and defaulted to $100,000 extra expense.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Could you please shed some light on why their is a -95% GL rate reduction? This is a composite rated GL policy....
__label__Package-General-Liability Team, we have a number of rating discrepancies for the GL issued policy.  The GL premium should be $38,046. The premium shown in UWS is not the same as on the issued declarations. What is shown in UWS is correct.The math isn't adding up to what is shown in CNA Central and now currently in TAP.  The first rating discrepancy was for class 91585 – 334. The rate of 1.895 x 5000 should equal $9,476 (see quote), but is shown as $7,199 (issued policy), which is incorrect. The second discrepancy is that the rates in TAP are different for each GL class and each location than when the policy was issued.  I have the opened the policy up as a Correction/Reissue in TAP for review. You can compare the rates with the Quote above. See TAP for each rate/class and compare to the worksheets attached.(2nd attachment) CNA Central - Rate X exposure does not equal for class 91585 – 334/Premises

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hi Team, I have an urgent request for the Pennsylvania experience Mod Worksheet. Are we able to get this or am I able to gain access to retrieve this info?
__label__Workers-Comp ​I am trying to get a renewal premium up on the WC.  UWS and RST show the WC is in AC.  When I changed the company to VF (which for AR should be less deviated), it took the premium down dramatically – instead of up.  So, I thought I looked at something wrong so took the company back to AC and the premium didn't match what UWS & RST was showing in the same company (no change in credits). Factors are the same (with no change in payroll) , only changed the company to VF and back to AC.  In looking at the WC screen in RST, I see the rate has gone down considerably. This would make more sense if I had not refreshed RST already…..but I had refreshed because I amended all the other lines yesterday.Are there any known issues with company deviations and premium changing?
__label__Package-General-Liability Hello FRC,The referenced account has an NPE policy for which the agent has requested a quote for tail/ERP coverage.   Processing returned the quote request asking for the premium.   I cannot find any information relating to ERP premium calculation in Resource Library.Please advise on the ERP premium for a 1 year and 3 year term.

__label__Umbrella ​Hello!Not sure where to go with this request but Field Underwriting Operations would very much appreciate an revised version of the Paramount Quick Rater tool that would allow saving and editing by others. Ideally, we have our UTs initiate the manual rate for Umbrella policies by entering the preliminary information in the PQR based on their interpretation of the updated underlying information. This is then sent or filed for the UW to review and recommend changes if needed. Right now that means the UW who wants to make changes needs to either advise the originating UT to make the edits or the UW has to start a fresh PQR from scratch. Would it be possible to create a revised version that could be edited by others, saving us time by making the process more efficient.Caroline

__label__Package-Property I have the endt, it's the one I sent you. However, I don't think you owe us the RP indicated on it. Per my emails this endorsement is just correcting a flood limit (increasing it) on the endt because it was correct in your system the first one just printed wrong (see highlighted from you below). I'll take the credit but you specifically asked me not to until you could find out why a reprint would give so much RP because we don't want to request it back when/if the error is corrected.If you want to confirm the credit is correct and will not be reversed I can close my file and have accounting clear it.

__label__Package-Property RE:  Pending Endorsement Effective 02/01/2018I need some assistance.  We quoted Ordinance or Law coverage on this renewal and gave the agent premium for Limit $500K and Limit $1,000,000.   Insured bound with Ordinance or Law limit at $500K and propertypremium of $15,560.(First attachment has the TAP rating worksheets for $500K and $1Mil so we could advise the agent of the premium difference). Policy issued but we left off the Ordinance or Law coverage.   A request was sent to CIET for addition of the coverage (Third attachment).  CIET has pushed back to UW.  PSR says the problem may be that the policy is EX and not SE.  TAP rating worksheets for both $500K and $1Mil show EX.   Per second attachment SE / EX comparison – you can have this coverage and changing the limit IS an option on EX policies.     Is there a way to add?  Please advise at your earliest.

__label__Auto ​I’m now confused on the renewal procedure whenever endorsements are processed on the expiring term.  My understanding was that all endorsements would be processed on the upcoming renewal rating as well, but as long as the quote hadn’t been released yet.  Did this change?  I’ve attached two endorsements that were processed on the expiring, but not carried over to the renewal.  Instead, I got an activity telling me that they didn’t endorse it.  This can possibly cause renewal quotes to be inaccurate and requires more time from the UT to research what changes were made and generate another rerate.  I’m hoping this is just because of the auto migration into EPC.  Thanks for checking on this.  
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Hi, I am reaching out as RST is inaccurately reflecting a rate decrease on the captioned account.

__label__Auto ​Hello,Hoping you can provide some insight - I have an insured, Fair Financial, who is an auto lease finance company who needs GKLL in certain states solely for state compliance. BUA #6050310950 …the need for garage keeper coverage is strictly to satisfy state licensing requirements. The Fair legal department, in working with the states determined the need for garage keeper coverage. Fair is required to have a physical location in each state and thus each state requires proof of insurance for each facility, even though in reality, no vehicles will be displayed, sold or serviced at any of the locations. Fair is a direct lease company not a pass-through agent for the dealers. Fair buys and owns the vehicles we lease to our customers.In analyzing the risk and from the direct feedback above from the insured – there is no real exposure to this coverage specifically but it's required for compliance. I want to alleviate as much as the premium charge as I can to partner with MMA and the insured. Aside from crediting the coverage is there any tricks you can advise on? I haven't worked with this coverage much.Thank you,

I assume the issue is that we previously had building coverage and now we don't. I did a manual calculation of rate using the starting point in 2017-18 and my average rate was $0.06312 when I excluded the building values and premiums from the calculation. Then I did the same manual rate calculation on the renewal exposures and my average rate is $0.08105. Therefore I see the rate as +28.4%

__label__Auto Hi Team:Please see some questions raised this morning during my MM UT meeting specifically centered around EPC Auto Experience rating.  If you require clarification, please feel free to reach out directly to Mary Schorn. New Business – PSRs should be reminded that entry of losses into EPC is required so they can feed into RST.  I had a new business account where I provided Prior Carrier, Valuation Date and No known losses in XPR period.  That information wasn't entered into EPC by the PSR.  I didn't realize it until I went into RST and received an error due to missing auto loss information.Renewals with all prior years with CNA:How are losses, specifically Physical Damage losses, feeding into EPC?  The reason for the question is the need to now split Comp/Collision losses for physical damage.  Is the system able to determine that information and feed correctly to EPC?  If not, what is the workflow for getting the correct information into EPC?Renewals where some or none of the prior year losses are with CNA?If we haven't received updated loss information, we would normally use same as expiring losses including the loss evaluation date.  Same question applies here, how are the Comp/Collision losses being split out? To the point which Tina brought up, if the system isn't able to break out the information automatically then wouldn't it make more sense to only worry about Comp/Collision splits on new business quotes?  If the UT has to either provide info to the PSR or manually enter the splits themselves this will have a terribly negative impact on productivity across the board.Let me know if you have any questions.

__label__Umbrella ​The expiring premium in the rate monitor section of  EPC does not match the issued premium.Our premium last year was $43,020 after endorsing terrorism off. It's showing expiring premium as $51,079 in the expiring premium field
__label__Package-Property Hello,Please see description of my situation related to this account.  What would be the recommended approach for resolving this issue?-------------------------------------------------------------------------As you have seen from the correspondence, when we pushed through the new/revised per unit water damage deductible, TAP rerated the policy such that we are calculating a $12k + return premium which was never our intent.  Evidently, the initial rating did not correctly contemplate that deductible and when we pushed through the new endorsement, I guess that triggered the system to fix the initial rating error.  HOWEVER, the policy premium at issuance is the premium we are comfortable with for the exposure.  I spoke with Michael.  He agrees that we do not need to return the premium to IOA/the insured.  Unfortunately, I don't think we have a way to manipulate the in force policy to cancel out the return of funds.  Thus, I believe the only solution is to cancel/rewrite the policy (as of inception), to include the current per unit water damage deductible endorsement and arrive at the same premium that we bound the policy with.  If you know of a way to accomplish what I am wanting to do, I am all ears and open to your suggestions but anticipate this being the route we must take.  Hopefully this makes sense and you will know how to take next steps.  As I am out next week, I am copying Megan who can help answer any questions you might have. Robbie – I am including you as an FYI since this is kind of an unusual request that might take some time to accommodate.

__label__Auto ​3/15 additional example from Kevin:Karen,Thank you!  I did have one other exactly the same day as the one I provided.  This did not result in an Experience mod being generated, but similarly the PSR noted they needed the additional year so it was not attempted – Thunder Scientific #3015805063.  I'll be sure to forward any other examples as they come up. I would like to add two other issues with the current workflow – the job aide I linked states Exception: Do NOT Experience rate Hired and Non-owned only policies unless requested by the UT (Underwriting Tech) or UW (Underwriter)  While not as common, the main criteria for Experience rating is usually Basic Limits premium, so this seems to be under the assumption the number of vehicles is required for experience rating.  I had several accounts previously with very large HNO exposures (Pharma, sales, service, consultants, etc - companies with high travel requirements) that easily qualified for experience mods ($5k-$60k HNO premium policies).  I do not believe the HNO exclusion would affect as many accounts but could still have an impact.  And being merit based, leaving it up to UW discretion could result insureds not getting the adjustment earned by their loss history. The other issue is even without an experience mod applying, we are unable to confirm Schedule mod eligibility without experience rating being completed – a key factor I feel many UW's utilize for pricing when we don't have an Experience credit, this is a more common issue with New Business to price if needed to be competitive.  When PSR's do not experience rate, some UT's will state Schedule mods are not eligible, removing it from the UW's options, even when it may be available. Let me know if there is anything else you may need.Thanks!Original email:FRC, I have recently had a string of accounts without experience rating being completed, when I believe it should be.  Most recent example is IT Connect #3030517040.  PSR's will not experience rate without 4 years provided, but I believe this is in error.  I've been pointed to the attached job aide as the reason why, however it seems to be driven by WWO, not by ISO rules for experience mod calculation.  ISO does not prohibit experience rating with less than 3 years, and I have done so at previous employers as well without issue.  Going into RST, I can complete with the information we do have and calculate an Experience mod and one does apply. While having a full loss history does help provide a complete picture of the insureds loss experience, there are numerous scenarios where this is a handicap or detriment to our pricing.  Many insureds even without a full 3-4 years of loss history would still be eligible for a credit/debit earned, although not as much without the full years.  Experience mods are purely merit based, not judgement rated so I believe we should be applying this with whatever information we have available – and allows us to have a starting point and something we can update later with additional provided information. Entities with less than 5 years in business are missing out of earned credits or debits based on their loss history.  Not all insurers are cooperative or timely in providing loss runs, which penalizes the insured – in the case where some credit could still be awarded based on information we do have. Since RST is not preventing experience mods from calculating without 4 full years, nor is there any ISO limitation I am aware of, I believe we should amend the workflow for this situation and request PSR's experience rate with whatever information we have available.

In both cases, the recommended company is used and is creating a 14% rate increase on one of the accounts, and a 39% rate increase on the other. This is a clean account with no losses so I know that the agent will not accept these huge increases.

__label__Not-LOB-Specific ​I have a question for you. We had an account merge in UWS. Account 3020514123 merged into account 3034970628. Of course, the RSTs were not merged. Is there any way we can take the information from Account 3020514123 with the policies associated with that account and set up an RST with the same information under account 3034970628. Please let me know if this can be done or if you need further clarification.
__label__Auto ​Good Afternoon, Can this  auto policy be reviewed in EPC and advise why the Liability symbol cannot be changed from symbol 1 to symbol 7. In trying to revise the quote for the U/W the change could not be made as symbol 7 field never opened up(grey outed)  in order to edit the symbols.  I'm out on vacation starting today and I'm the back up on this account so please be sure to include all contacts copied in on this email with the resolution to the issue. Your time and attention to this matter is greatly appreciated. 
__label__Package-General-Liability Good morning,I am having a frustrating interaction with an endorsement contractor.Per the attached resource guidelines, the pricing is outlined showing 1M  Occ and 2M aggregate for drone coverage. It states that the occurrence policy level limit will apply. I am attempting to match my GL limits as suggested with a 2M aggregate for the drone endorsement. The processor will not let me do so, as he states the Agg on the endorsement cannot be greater than the occurrence limit on the policy per the correspondence below.I have all required documentation to process the request including FAA registrations and we have been going back and forth on this topic for weeks now. Can you please advise. Many thanks for your time,
__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello, There appears to be an IT endorsement processing error. We processed an endorsement to remove IF ANY NY exposure and it charged $6. I reviewed the WC endorsement processed on 7/3/18 for policy 6056739822 . It looks like there is an error where it is charging $6. We will get this fixed. From discussions in the office it sounds like it is an IT error surrounding TRIA,. It may take a few days to get backed out and corrected. I will send up a rush request today J 
__label__Monoline ​Hi, Neither of these has any premium listed. Please contact the field resource center for assistance in revising this. Once complete, please resend to the processing box for booking/ issuance. We can not proceed until the corrected binder is received back.

__label__Package-Property ​Quick question.  There are significant ITV issues on the property line for this renewal.   As a solution, I will be offering an Agreed Amount like program in which I am rating for the higher limit in TAP Rating System but offering the lower original limit as requested.   When I adjusted all the limits in TAP, I noticed that the property rate action is now negative 7%.  Is this correct?  I don't want to take a negative rate in which I am actually rating for higher exposure basis.   Thoughts?
__label__Umbrella ​I tried to do a correction/reissue first on US Bancorp to see if that would trigger the quota share form to show 66.7 in lieu of 66% but it didn't.  One note of concern – I rated the policy to retrigger the form and it changed the premium L??I thought I would check with you before trying a cancel/rewrite because I'm assuming it will change the premium also?Regards,
__label__Package-General-Liability I'm having trouble reconciling the reason that this account still owes $9,440.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hi, Please review the correspondence chain below in relation to the WC policy number cited above.This policy was issued at $95,737We then had to do a cancel re-write in order to get the appropriate entities scheduled and the premium was issued at $95,652We then had an endorsement processed effective at inception to add if any exposure in the state of Wisconsin.  That change yielded an $85 premium. Since the agent is confused about the original amount charged I think we can explain that by pointing attention toward the endorsement.  That said, this is a VERY detailed agent and they are going to inquire why there was an AP charge to add if any exposure.  I'm not sure what the reason for that charge is and I'm hoping someone can help me with an explanation. Thanks,Dan
__label__Auto I just went through the EPC training and I don't think the example is correct.  On the attached worksheet page 29 they are showing a loss where the insured rear ended another vehicle with damage to the insureds vehicle as comprehensive.  The definition of comprehensive coverage in the auto coverage form is From any cause except:  1.  The covered auto's collision with another object or 2.  The covered auto's overturn.  The loss would be collision since the insured was at fault. Thanks,Pat
__label__Package-General-Liability Hello,This correction reissue was done back in Feb switching from Agency Bill to Direct Bill but I don't see that it was added to the insured's overall invoice. The agent is asking where the updated bill is. Can you please help me track down or figure out how the insured is going to be billed for this correction reissue.Thank you! 
__label__Auto Hello,I have a few questions related to the highlighted email below:If an insured has employees using their own vehicles, and there is non-owned coverage in place, and the auto is being used for business, would the personal auto policy respond first, or the BAP? Just want to clarify.If the trucks are non-owned, but the trailers are owned by the company and scheduled on the policy, do any aspects of coverage change once the trailers are attached to the vehicles?Below the agent mentioned needing an MCS-90, but I would not expect this to be needed in this scenario? Isn't the MCS 90 only needed for trucking/hauling type exposures?

__label__Package-Property ​Hello, I am looking to see if we provide any sort of builder's risk coverage for properties that are on the schedule that are undergoing a renovation. This is on our Paramount form and I was first looking at Section N. Newly Acquired Locations and Property Coverage – 1. New Acquired or Constructed Real Property. This seems to only provide coverage for locations that are newly built and wouldn't include and renovations to the existing location. Is there a way we can provide this builder's risk for hard and soft costs  up to a certain limit/ certain amount of days on the PMT? We are competing with Zurich and under the term sheet provided by the broker, they indicated that builder's risk/renovation projects coverage is included. Thanks and please feel to reach out if you need more info! Matt Rutz |CNA

__label__Package-General-Liability Is there a job aid that speaks to the need to close out not taken opportunities in EPC?  There seems to be many UWS that think if they close in Salesforce, it will come off the Production Tracking Tool. We know you can push from EPC opportunities to feed to Salesforce (as defined by the job aid attached).  However, there is a misconception that Salesforce feeds back to EPC.   I think this job aid needs to be updated to point out that EPC feeds Salesforce but Salesforce does not feed EPC or we need a job aid on closing items in EPC and why they have to be closed in that system regardless of any other system you may use.   Sorry for the ramble…just having many UWS complaining about closing items in SF and being confused as to why they are still showing as open in the production tracking tool. I can educate them individually but a job aid would be helpful for a wider distribution. Thanks,

__label__Workers-Comp ​Good afternoon!  Can you please assist with the following three items?  Thank you!  1.      MISSOURI COMPLIANCE (MO location with payroll): For any policy with MO exposure/payroll, we are required to verify that MO compliance guidelines have been met before we are allowed to issue. The only mention of MO compliance we can find is from 2017 in UWS showing the below. Based on that information, the agent is not licensed in MO; therefore we would not be allowed to issue this policy with the state of MO on it. Please provided updated proof of MO compliance being met. I have included the job aid link below, showing that we are not allowed to proceed with issuance until this information has been confirmed.https://refdocs.cna.com/WorkplaceXT/getContent?objectStoreName=kbos&id=release&objectType=document&vsId={101A2557-0900-C2A4-8008-E878C393C3C6}    2.      PREMIUM DIFFERENCE:Please be advised that the final NJ EMOD is .884 (in lieu of the tentative .867 rating that was previously quoted). After updating the policy in accordance with the NJ bureau, the new premium per EPC is $300,880 in lieu of $300,753 on the issue instructions. Please advise  if okay to proceed with issuance.  3.      UIN:Please provide a valid UIN for the ME location.  This is required in order to issue the policy.  NOTE:  Please be advised that at least one of the states on the policy requiring a specific location address when applicable, is currently listed as non-specific. We will issue the policy using the no specific location verbiage per EPC; if/when any applicable location addresses are provided, the policy can be updated via endorsement accordingly. The non-specific states currently requiring a location address if one applies are:AL, AK, AZ, KY, ME, MT, NE, NH, NV, RI, SC, & WI. (Please note that employee's home addresses are not considered valid location addresses and would instead use the NSL verbiage.)

(CNA62834IL 0417?  Can you please delete it from the renewal?- Also, form CNA75108 01/15 is listed under the GL portion of the quote and is new this year; I pulled it from the website and it references the employee benefits liability coverage part but in reading the form, it doesn't make sense.  It references the Who is an Insured section and Paragraph 3. Under the EB coverage part and I can't find those in the EB form.  Can you please advise?  Could this have been the wrong form?-Finally, Form G142630A 0502 references information needed for autos – I don't think this applies since you don't have to register the vehicles on behalf of the insured in Illinois.  Since I do not provide the License plate for our insured's autos, do you need any further information per the requirements in this form?I did no request any of these forms to be added at renewal.

__label__Auto Uws quote indicates NA for collision state of Mi . In epc the coll. ded is 1000.

This misread is misleading and confusing to the agent.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​In reviewing rater tech notes on a renewal I noticed an underwriter was changed per the Salesforce Middle Market tool.  I have reached out to several people and no one seems to be quite sure what it is.  If it truly does exist somewhere, it has incorrect information.  As per the screen shot below, Marcy Ramirez is no long our FI UW and it should have been left showing Byrd's name (easy correction).  I also noted this was done only on the auto policy and not on the other lines.  If someone can help in directing us to this tool I would greatly appreciate it.
__label__Monoline There was a PST document that outlined how you would come up with a rate, but I can no longer find it.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Team, Please confirm – if we are within 7 days of the effective date on a FT renewal and we have received no response from the agency regarding authorization to bind coverage – should we be binding coverage based off expiring?

__label__Package-General-Liability Hi,Per the screenshot, this renewal went through the PGL conversion for the current renewal term. We are priced at a flat rate based off of the old rating base but this has changed from Area to other and is therefore showing a rate decrease. Can this be corrected? I don't see it fair to negatively impact my rate goals based off of an internal switch that both I and the insured had no control over.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​It appears that the highlighted yellow lines are being populated on the quote proposal in error. When summing the GL premiums on the quote proposal, the $500 charge is not included in the total GL premium of $87,475.23, so it seems that these lines are just appearing on the proposal with no premium impact. Can you look into this matter and advise? The account is Nu-Tek Roof Systems,  Account Number 3029180112. Please call with any questions.

__label__Package-General-Liability Please review the correspondence chain below and the attached underwriting guidelines for drones.  I am being informed that we cannot amend the charge for drones on the GL policy (number above), but the attached underwriting guidelines would suggest that NY is an A-rate state so I don't understand why we are unable to charge $500 per drone on an annualized basis.The full correspondence chain is included, but my endorsement request is highlighted for convenience.

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello, All Workers Compensation files electronically for all carriers through WCPOLS by issuance of the policy or endorsement. There is no manual filing. NCCI and the states will only accept the electronic filing which is produced by issuance of the policy or endorsement. The electronic feed goes out in a batch to NCCI and the states in the evening. NCCI accepts or rejects the policy the next day. Independent states have different schedules on when they accept the information usually 3-7 business days. NY is looking for coverage for Misys International Banking Systems INC. effective 12/31/2017. The name in question is not present on the policy, linked to the NY location with the NY UI so there would not be proof of coverage in NY for the entity. If there was a name change effective 12/31/2017 then an ERM-14 will need to be provided to the NY bureau and the insured will need to respond to the NY bureau fine letter to advise of the change in name.
__label__Package-General-Liability Good Afternoon,I was hoping to get an update on the above account as to why the GL pricing dropped so significantly for the upcoming renewal. It appears the exposure has stayed the same,  the only thing I believe has changed is the contractors gl and Sub contractors blanket ai both dropped on the renewal. I am not really sure why they would have dropped in this case. Let me know if you need any additional info.Thanks,

__label__Workers-Comp ​Please see below.  We have a situation where we are being told that we cannot issue a policy as quoted because the mod changed between the time we quoted and the time we issued.  We acknowledge that the policy will need to be endorsed to reflect the correct mod, but there are other complications as a result of not being able to issue as quoted.  See below.  Pat Quinn is prepared to go to LOB, but I would like confirmation that the direction provided by the PSR is accurate.

__label__Umbrella ​Hello~ I need to report an issue I'm still having after an EPC fix.  EPC is still dropping endorsements with old edition dates when I go in to make a change that has nothing to do with those endorsements: specifically CNA75575XX.  However, I am now noticing that another endorsement is automatically being added as well.  Here are the scenarios: Flad Affiliated (5094636998): I needed to change a policy number on the Schedule of Underlying Insurance and EPC dropped the Contractors Limitation Endorsement (CNA75575XX).  It also automatically added the Amendment to Named Insured (CNA88301XX) to the policy. Rite-Hite (6020668726): I needed to add a NOC to Certholder endorsement to the policy.  After that, scenario is the same as Flad.     I understand that I can add-back the newer edition date for CNA75575XX, but the fix was supposed to rectify this situation, yes?  As far as the NI endorsement, even if it is advantageous to the Insured, should the system be adding endorsements automatically?  I was working with Kris Iannacone on these and she told me to go ahead and report them as the system should not be doing this anymore.  Thanks so much~

__label__Package-General-Liability Sorry, I hit send before I was finished and also did not include the FRC. With the assistance of the Field Resource Center, I suggest that Eve disperse Policy level Coverages (subject to contractors roll-up) among different Composite Groups.There is premium for other 334/336 classifications in the underlyingCLASS CODE: 91580  (Contractors Executive Supervisors or Executive Superintendents)CLASS CODE: 91342  (Carpentry - not otherwise classified )CLASS CODE: 91560  (Concrete Construction) (a very small amount)During contractors roll-up, premium is allocated among all applicable 334/336 classes in proportion.Policy level Coverages (subject to contractors roll-up) in this policyContractors General Liability Extension EndorsementDamage to Sub-Contractors Work EndorsementGeneral Contractor's Blanket Additional InsuredEve is correct in that the underlying final 334/336 final rates for Class Code 91585 include the allocation for the above contractors roll-up coverages – but only for the proportional amount bases on the % of premium for the contractors roll-up coverage calculated and allocated to that class.When the contractors roll-up class codes are slotted to the same Composite Group that includes Class Code 91585, the system will use all premium for the contractors roll-upclasses (not just the % allocated to 91585) to calculate the composite rate. So l believe the system is functioning as designed but I understand Eve's concern.

__label__Package-General-Liability FRC: The audit for the 2016/17 term on the above captioned policy has been in dispute for some time now and we have been unable to find a resolution to the brokers satisfaction.During the life of this policy a number of endorsements, endorsement revisions and a cancel rewrite have been processed on this policy. This is causing confusion on what should be the correct total previously charged amount that should be used on the audit.The endorsements issued prior to the correction reissue appear to be affecting the total previously charged amount on the audit.Per the audit department, currently our CNA systems are showing $14,675 as the total previously charged amount. Audit has indicated that they are unable to change the total previously charged amount manually.  Marsh believes the total previously charged amount should be either $10,748 or $10,964 per the attached spreadsheet.I do not think this is an issue I can resolve via another endorsement given the amount of already processed endorsements, endorsement revisions and the correction reissue as well other factors like rate changes. Especially if a change request is sent attempting to amend an exposure.Please review and advise on what you determine would be the best possible way to resolve this issue.

__label__Not-LOB-Specific ​FRC, I'm seeking some clarifications on the BOR process.  Written documentation and the real world application do not seem to match up, so I want to be sure BOR's are being handled correctly. http://refdocs.cna.com/WorkplaceXT/getContent?objectStoreName=kbos&id=release&objectType=document&vsId={20245B5C-0000-CF11-AC26-686BBDA912FB} I found the attached Job Aid and it states:There is a change in the recognized Broker of Record. The current broker of record will have recourse to submit a rescinding letter within 10 business days. CNA does receive requests to waive the 10 business day waiting period at times, although we do not accept these requests. The CNA contract clearly states that the original agent has 10 business days and we will honor this agreement in all cases, with the exception of CNA Select Risk which states that the original agent has a 5 business day waiting period. I take this to mean even if we get the losing agent to agree to waive the waiting period, CNA will not take any action and allow the full 10 business days to pass.  Is this correct? What is happening frequently is a BOR will come in, UW's will contact the respective agents and they will ask if they want to waive the waiting period.  When they do, UT's are tasked with immediately switching policies over to the new agent, before the 10 days passes – sometimes even the same day a BOR letter is received.  Applications and updates to the policy for the new agent will be sent to WWO immediately and the new agent is set up before the 10 day window expires. Can or should we honor requests to waive the 10 day waiting period?  During the 10 day period, should we take any steps outside of sending the BOR letters to make the BOR change over happen?

Hired Auto has a countrywide coverage territory.G. Hired AutosThe following is added to Section III. Paragraph A.:If Physical Damage coverage is provided under this policy, and such coverage does not extend to Hired Autos, then Physical Damage coverage is extended to:a. Any covered auto you lease, hire, rent or borrow without a driver; andb. Any covered auto hired or rented by your employee without a driver, under a contract in that individual employee's name, with your permission, while performing duties related to the conduct of your business.c.

No deductible applies to loss caused by fire or lightning.d. The physical damage coverage as is provided by this provision will be limited to the types of physical damage coverage(s) provided on your owned autos.e. Such physical damage coverage for hired autos will:(1) Include loss of use, provided it is the consequence of an accident for which the Named Insured is legally liable, and as a result of which a monetary loss is sustained by the leasing or rental concern.(2) Such coverage as is provided by this provision G.e.(1) will be subject to a limit of $750 per accident.Question #3Policy has symbol 7 --- confirming Insured has hired auto PD coverage Yes, they have Hired Auto PD coverage. This being the case it appears the answer #1 above is option #2.I attached the quote I sent for reference.  Please let me know if you need any clarity before answering. 
__label__Workers-Comp ​Good morning!  Can you please assist with the following information?  Thank you!  MISSOURI COMPLIANCE (MO location with payroll): For any policy with MO exposure/payroll, we are required to verify that MO compliance guidelines have been met before we are allowed to issue.

Based on that information, the agent is not licensed in MO and therefore we would not be allowed to issue this policy with the state of MO on it. Please provide updated proof of MO compliance being met. I have included the job aid link below, showing that we are not allowed to proceed with issuance until this information has been confirmed.  If you need assistance please reach out to the Field Resource Center.https://refdocs.cna.com/WorkplaceXT/getContent?objectStoreName=kbos&id=release&objectType=document&vsId={101A2557-0900-C2A4-8008-E878C393C3C6}

__label__Monoline FRC,I'm reaching out on guidance for the correct process for Builders Risk coverage we should be following. Currently in the workflow published in resource library states to use the home state unless given specific instructions to use the state with the greatest exposure. I had an underwriter (correspondence attached) that thought we automatically added the primary risk state with the greatest exposure. Since this is contrary to the documented process is the below still accurate? Or is this from a Middle Market standpoint and not an Inland Marine standpoint for Builders risk? Per Resource Library…. The Primary Risk State or home state is generally the insured's headquarters state.The PSR should use the state in the insured's mailing address of the policy as the insured's headquarters state, unless the following exception applies:Exception: When the headquarter state differs from the state with the greatest exposure for the line of business, the underwriter has the ultimate authority to deviate.  The underwriter bears the responsibility and has the ultimate authority to determine the primary risk state and may request one that differs from the mailing address state based upon his or her analysis of the exposures on the policy*These instructions can be found under All Lines Primary Risk State.  https://refdocs.cna.com/WorkplaceXT/getContent?objectStoreName=kbos&id=release&objectType=document&vsId={50EF2357-0100-CC84-AE91-9A1932BAB9F7}

__label__Package-Property Working on renewal on this account. When we quote renewal with expiring business income limit at $1.6M with same schedule mod and company placement, the RST was showing 0% rate comparing to last year. After amended the business income limit from $1.6M to $8.5M , with same schedule mod and company placement - remain unchanged, property rate in RST is now showing -21%. Please advise why rate now showing -21% when we increase exposure and did not change any schedule mod and company placement? Thank you. Ethan

__label__Workers-Comp Hello FRC,My insured purchased a company and I think completed an ERM14 which in turn changed their mod to reflect the new entity so our processing team did a cancel re-write without notifying the agent, underwriting, or the insured. It there a way to make this new emod only apply starting when they purchased the company rather than going back to inception? The agent is asking for some relief since the mod swung form a credit to a debit.I need to get back to my agent today.

__label__Umbrella ​Good Morning,   I would like your feedback regarding the Credit/Debit Worksheet for the Umbrella Policies.   Currently we use the Legal Statement and we mark the following no matter what is on the Umbrella:   Eligible for Schedule Rating – A review indicates this risk did not vary from the expected MOD 1.00. One of the Underwriters in this office was audited and the Auditor advised that this is not the correct way to do the Credit/Debit worksheet on the Umbrella and it was counted against her. So here is my question to you:   What form are we supposed to use for the Credit/Debit worksheet on the Umbrella?  Also, since the credits/debits and documentation is done on the Umbrella in RST by the Underwriter why would we even need to do another worksheet for the Umbrella.  It seems to me that this is just duplicating work and this Legal Form doesn't have a place to list anything but the above. Please review and advise.
__label__Auto ​ Could someone please check the auto rate?  This is the second one I've had where no auto changes have taken place and I am moving companies/increasing premium to a point there should be a 5 to 10% rate increase and RST is showing 0%.

__label__Not-LOB-Specific ​We are looking for a point person to work with the Zone Ops leaders for UT Training on a particular item – new processing code requests. The intent of this process is for an accurately completed code request form to be sent from the Branch Admin to Sioux Falls to ensure a new processing code is opened correctly.  S&D developed a checklist to help the UT, but we don't direct their work and we don't have the expertise to provide them with the full direction around this process.  If the Zone Ops/ Branches determine the UT is the best to complete the form then we need to ensure the process can be perpetuated. Who will give newly hired UTs the job aides (the checklist that S&D Developed and other job aides you would deem necessary)?Where do UTs pull the information needed manually (can be a job aide but not one that S&D would maintain) ?Can an automated form be created to populate key information needed for the code request form (like the BOR letters pull in certain info automatically)? (S&D can't develop but would work with Zone Ops group and FRC to incorporate this into our process instead of requiring re-keying into a form). Background:Branch Admins are responsible for agency maintenance in their branches. And, are going to be most heavily trained on agency maintenance process/procedures.  So, new processing code requests go through Branch Admins (they double check if a code already exists and the form is complete to eliminate inefficiencies from it getting bounced back)As forms change the admins are given notice of the change and in some cases a training session is held (if extensive changes or if an admin is new)A form exists for consistency of processing (and again to eliminate back and forth from missing info)In many Branches the Branch admins direct the UTs to be responsibility to complete the forms, because they have the information needed - instead of getting an e-mail with info that is then transferred to a form.S&D was given direction not to train UTs on how to fill out the forms but wanted to revisit this direction because the Branches do push this work to the UTs.  (S&D would not do training outside of working through Zone Ops leaders).Not their core jobs;  not a process they do daily or even weekly necessarilyWe don't know where they find the information they need to complete the formsBranch Admins would typically ask questions to get the information needed to complete the forms.We direct Branch Admin work relative to Agency Maintenance; we don't direct UT work at all.S&D Developed a checklist for completing the forms to help the UTs.

__label__Workers-Comp Hello Patricia,All Workers Compensation files electronically for all carriers through WCPOLS by issuance of the policy or endorsement. There is no manual filing. NCCI and the states will only accept the electronic filing which is produced by issuance of the policy or endorsement. The electronic feed goes out in a batch to NCCI and the states in the evening. NCCI accepts or rejects the policy the next day. Independent states have different schedules on when they accept the information usually 3-7 business days.The mid-term location endorsement 8/14/17, coverage for NY was added and expired on the same date. You will need to place a ticket with the Help Desk.

__label__Package-General-Liability Hi— I need to ask your assistance in helping to resolve this issue. Per the correspondence below, we quoted/bound an A&E new account with a GL endorsement that better fit the risk than the auto-generated CNA74980. The two endorsements conflict so shouldn't both be on the policy, but we're having issues with WWO/TAP on suppressing the auto-generated endorsement and replacing it with the one that best fits the risk (and was quoted and bound) - CNA74801.Some of the solutions below, while may provide work-around options, are not palatable to the branch as we'd be going back to the client and agent within a key segment and have the perception of 're-negotiating' our terms post-binding, mainly due to a system constraint.Blair Shropshire (copied) is the UW and can provide any additional detail necessary, but hopefully you can assist and help us get this new 1/1 client's policy issued as bound.Thanks,Ryan

__label__Auto Hello,See page 10 on the policy on the first attachment and see screen shots of TAP on the second attachment towards the middle. Our Claims Department states they are not seeing the Hired PD deductible in COVERS per email chain attached on the 2nd attachment. They also discovered that the policy is showing Symbol 8 on the Dec with a $2,500 deductible-see page 10 on the attached first attachment.  Only Garage Keepers coverage have a $2,500 deductible on it – see page 256 on the first attachment. I sent to the Help Desk to have it corrected (see draft on last attachment). The Help Desk is asking me to confirm the print on the last attachment. Could you please confirm how the policy is supposed to print? What should print on the policy on page 10? Should it lists symbol 8 instead of stating the deductible is for Garage Keepers and not Symbol 8 for Hired auto? Thank you,

__label__Workers-Comp ​Good morning!  Can you please assist with the following information?  Thank you! 1.      MISSOURI COMPLIANCE (MO location with payroll): For any policy with MO exposure/payroll, we are required to verify that MO compliance guidelines have been met before we are allowed to issue. There is no mention of MO compliance in UWS or DMF. Please provide updated proof of MO compliance being met. I have included the job aid link below, showing that we are not allowed to proceed with issuance until this information has been confirmed.  Our hands are tied as far as issuing the policy with MO on it until MO compliance has been met and we have proof that the agent is licensed to write insurance in the state of MO. If the policy needs to be issued for premium close, and you are not able to obtain the necessary proof in time, we can remove MO from the policy and issue accordingly until it is obtained, at which point MO can be added back on via endorsement. Please advise if you would like us to do that; otherwise, FRC can further assist you regarding the matter of MO proof of compliance if needed. https://refdocs.cna.com/WorkplaceXT/getContent?objectStoreName=kbos&id=release&objectType=document&vsId={101A2557-0900-C2A4-8008-E878C393C3C6}   2.      NOTE:Please be advised that at least one of the states on the policy requiring a specific location address when applicable, is currently listed as non-specific. We will issue the policy using the no specific location verbiage per EPC; if/when any applicable location addresses are provided, the policy can be updated via endorsement accordingly. The non-specific states currently requiring a location address if one applies are:SC.

__label__Package-Property ​Property question. This is a June renewal and I discussed this with David Nordhues (Western Zone Property Line Leader; and co-author of our Property Paramount forms) at renewal.  At the time I had a vacant building that was on the market to sell; and hadn't sold at renewal.  While I did not want to stop our property form from decreasing coverage after the 60 days of vacancy I did know the property was vacant and I did not want us to nullify all coverage for vandalism. Unless I misunderstood David (Nordhues) he advised 1) I had authority for the Vacancy Clause and 2) there was no cost; so at renewal we add C.N.A. 62748xx 1015 and low and behold the policy is $3K higher than we quoted.  I had FRC track back why the A/P and it was decided the cause was the Vacancy Endorsement. The actual clause itself does not stipulate what it does; but I'm assuming for the $3K additional it negates the decrease in coverage for those locations we have the vacancy clause attached?  Since it was my intention to NOT negate the policy language do we just need to remove the vacancy clause endorsement? 
__label__Workers-Comp ​Hi Kevin,     I checked the policy and Form# WC470301 is a system generated form due to State of WV being scheduled on the policy.

__label__Auto Hi,Attached is a copy of COI for an Auto that one of our Insured's is adding to their Auto policy. The policy # is 2048910336. The Insured needs the 2018 Starcraft Allstar to show up on their existing Auto policy. We processed an endorsement adding the vehicle but because of the vin # the Auto description changes to 2017 Chevrolet Express G4.  I've attached a copy of the endt. processed yesterday that amends the vehicle description to the 2017 Auto. The vehicle should read 2018 Starcraft Allstar. See agent's explanation below as to why we're having this issue: 
__label__Auto ​We have a renewal that converted to EPC, the following form was on the expiring policy but did not generate in EPC. CA9916B Hired Autos Specified as Covered Autos You OWN. We have only H&NO coverage on the policy, no vehicles. Is this form not generating because we do not have vehicles? 
__label__Package-General-Liability ​RST is stating that the loss data needs to be updated in EPC when the loss info is available (copied below).  However, the auto has been insured w/ CNA since 2010 (copied below).Why is EPC not re-experience rating itself based on CNA info that should automatically that's available when re-rated?Thank you.

__label__Workers-Comp I am elevating yet another problem with specific waivers.   Below is a snippet from a 5/1 renewal I am working on.   The renewal should have 4 waivers.Since the 1st wc000313 falls off to make place for the placeholder wc000313, I should have 3 specific waivers completed under the forms.  There are none and the waiver out there shows blanket.   We did not have blanket waiver on this policy so I don't know where this came from. So now instead of having to add 1 waiver wording back on, 3 need to be added.  (1 waiver being removed per renewal updates).  I had seen this on another account recently but was hoping it was a one off problem.  Can someone please look into this issue.  Thanks,  Sue

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Good morning FRC team, We've got a renewal coming up quickly and we can't figure out what the PSR did exactly to cause the rate increase of +37%, see below screen shot.   I also included the PSR's notes from the RTN, but I still can't figure it out.  We have very few CNP policies here in MM, so I'm definitely a novice at them! Lol    We're thinking that most of the increase is in the BI rating change, but when I go in and remove the $17M sales entry and re-rate, the premium/rate only changes a little.  It could also be something else causing the rate increase that we're unfamiliar with all together.   Please review and let us know.  Thank you much!

__label__Auto Good Afternoon.Hope you are doing well today.I recently received an inquiry from an agent regarding our ability to providing the following language for individuals covered under DOC on the auto:Any employee assigned a company auto who is not covered under a Personal Auto policy (Liability, Medical Payments, Uninsured/Underinsured Motorists, Comp and Collision)The agent indicated that other carriers have provided this language for them and manuscripted if they did not already have this option available.  I advised that I was not aware of CNA offering this option and our current practice is listing each individual on DOC and being able to review their MVR.I understand the agent's position, especially when you have a large auto schedule with many drivers assigned a company car.  The account in question is an insurance company (Safe Auto).  The charges to list each driver on DOC could really add up if you have a large list.  Also, you would already be reviewing the MVRs and driver attributes as part of the underwriting process.  Would it be possible to use the wording requested by the agent and have we done anything like this in the past that you are aware of?Please let me know if you need any additional information from me.I appreciate you looking into this for me.Thanks again and have a great day!

__label__Auto I ​have talked with a few underwriters and the agent is showing one rate change in their calculations but we are showing a -8% rate decrease at the price he is showing a rate increase. I will send over the analysis he provided as this is composite rated once I receive a response of who is working on this. I did take this out of composite rating to the rating. _____At 41K we were showing a 20% rate increase and 0% rate according to him would be just around 35K. I disagree with him on his expiring analysis with flat being more around 37K due to trailers added, but at 38K we are showing an -8% decrease. The physical damage and liability emods both went up significantly, but my thought is that should be reflected in our rate and not sure if it currently is. Thank you for your help!

__label__Package-General-Liability Hello,I am working on a renewal, MMS Solutions of South Carolina (PMT 6042670498), and I am concerned that the XPR tool is not calculating correctly. There are a few reasons why:The ELR factor does not correspond with the rating company the GL is rated in (ELR is for CCC and rated in NF)the last GL XPR calc was done in June. I received updated apps with updated exposures in July. When recalculating, the Prem Detail did not change.The exposures have increased with the renewal apps, so I would expect the XPR to decreaseThere have been minor losses in comparison to the premium, not enough that I would expect a debit mod, or at least one this debited (1.12)The loss valuation dates will not stick when I calculateI have had some of these issues before, and when the ELR is wrong or the valuation dates are wrong, it leads me to believe the mod is wrong as well. Is there a way to verify?

__label__Workers-Comp ​Hello, I need your help!The insured is facing a $13,500 fine, when they technically had NY WC coverage from 12/22/16-12/30/16 and then 12/30/16 to 12/30/17.  This account was non renewed 12/30/17-18.I first sent the request to FSR- WC filing Department and was told :  This policy was cancelled and re-written 12/22/16 to change the effective dates using the same policy number. For NY, a new policy number must be used and it has to be issued as New Business. The insured shows no NY coverage for our policy.  You will have to send the policy to processing to have it re-written for the terms with a new policy number.I then sent a rush cancel/rewrite for them to set up a new WC policy number and copy the information from the old policy to the new policy number for the 12/30/16-17 policy term. I was told:  In regards to the below email, this not something that the issuance team can do but rather you need to send request to FSR. Please have new account set up a new policy with new number and request the FSR department to cancel the old policy  number.  Once the new policy is issued, then it can be rolled over for the 12/30/16-17 term with same number and issued. I then set up a new policy number in EPC 6075780660?  Not sure if this is something that will need to be done in the old system (pledge) ? I am not sure what I should do next?    If FSR cancels the 16-17 policy term, How do I get the new WC policy number rated and issued? Please advise the best way to get this situation resolved.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​FRC,We insurer Kukrin Contracting (Utility Contractor) They are questioning the difference between the attached endorsements. The HF Lenz endorsement ($400) is for A&E who arenot engaged by the named insured but are required to be added as AI. The 2nd endorsement provided is encompasses all A&E firms whoare engaged by the named insured. My agent is looking for clarification on what engaged means. I understand it is not a defined term but perhaps an example may help clear up the difference and determine if the charge is needed. 
__label__Package-General-Liability ​This has been a real problem for us lately and now I am getting things returned without rating.  The PSR was correct to return but the tool we use for preparing new business are a challenge for us.  Many of the Proprietary class codes indicate they do not require an ELP when they actually do.  Code 80168 – Vacant land is a perfect example.  The mapping tool indicates no ELP required. Since I know it does require an ELP I automatically add the ELP W/S.  Other codes we use infrequently also require an ELP but the tool indicates they don't.  When we need a rush rating this can be a challenge for us.  I recently had a rush returned to me without rating as class code 70065 required an ELP.  I did check the tool prior to sending and it clearly shows an ELP is not required.  It would be extremely helpful if this spreadsheet could be updated to show accurate information for us.

__label__Monoline ​I am being requested to utilize BPMT for Equipment Breakdown.  We have explored this option previously, but have shut it off for the following reasons. Current status of BPMT is that it is shut off for Equipment Breakdown that is under BM code in BPMT •         BM that is included in the package was causing the overall rate % in BPMT being skewed for the overall account•         Decision was made not to keep BM open since it was impacting the entire account rate %•         Examples were the EB premium change was a $1 difference from prior year and it yielded a double digit negative rate on the entire account, not just the BM rate•         Not entirely sure if they figured out the hang ups, but just decided to take away the EB rate component and BPMT captured the accurate rate on the package business As for us using BPMT for BM               •         As noted above there is a rate capture issue on the BM portion of the package policy•         As for BM monoline, since the rating was turned off the for the policy prefix BM, we never used it since it didn't capture rate since it's turned off•         In addition, we would have the additional information that gets capture in BPMT for monoline BMo   Grade/Factor, Discretionary Factor, Policy Status (our policies don't get turned in the system, they just get issued)o   All the Detail Information and Summary Information for the BM line is obsolete as it is not captured due to the main reason  We use TAP as an issuance tool, not a step in the processing of a renewal•         The Information in BPMT, although useful, does not fit into the current workflowo   For our auto renewals (fast track accounts) which is the majority of the policy count, it would be added steps to document BPMT I'd like to explore how to move forward with having BPMT work appropriately for Equipment Breakdown.

__label__Package-General-Liability Good morning FRC Team,Can you provide us some guidance on this situation.  I know that we can only offer incidental Hawaii exposure on our GL.  The SOV that is attached.  A majority of the exposure is on the mainland and in AZ.  Below is a snap shot of the SOV for quick reference. -Mainland:435 Acres18 Office Buildings (satellite office in Scottsdale)6 Retail7 DwellingsHawaii:20 Acres4 Office (Main Corporate office in Hawaii)I over looked that the corporate office was based in Hawaii with a local satellite office located here in Scottsdale.  Since the majority of the exposure is still on the mainland could we still write the exposure while still sending the billing to their corporate office in Hawaii?  Or would the billing have to go to the Scottsdale office, in order for us to write the account?Currently Travelers is on the account,  The account goes to market every 5 years, but  has been with Travelers for many years.  This year Steve Parisi from large property, is working on the property portion of the account, while my piece would be the GL and the HNO auto.  Steve is confident that we could provide some competitive pricing on the property.  Loss history has been favorable.The Property portion is about $200K, and the GL and Auto is about $65K.  Can we still proceed in quoting this exposure?  If so, could we still have it billed to their corporate office in Hawaii?Kind regards,

__label__Auto ​Essentially I have a large renewal and the rating was not calculated correctly last year. It is written with composite auto. The PIP coverage was left off in MI. This year it has been rated correctly and the PIP has been applied to each vehicle – it is in the 200+ range per vehicle. Problem is RST is not including the PIP coverage as part of the rate it seems. So Rst is showing +3.4 % when the change in premium is far more dramatic. I want to get the rate to above what it was per vehicle last year, but to do so rst will be showing a massive decrease if it follows how it is currently structured in the system.

__label__Auto Can someone please call me regarding Presbyterian Manor Auto policy. The auto renewed 5/1 and the agent needed the payment plan prior to the policy being issued so we had billing give them a split.   When we sent for issuance, we told them to have the policy reflect the payment split exactly the way billing outlined it however, the split came in slightly different than what billing originally gave us.  We sent in a request for this to be changed and we were advised we had to go to billing to get that done.  Billing advised they can't change the payment plan as that is the way that the system generates it.  Spoke to Mark Pignotti who advised that with something where the difference is this small, it typically would not cause any issues at all as Lockton is handled somewhat differently...they pretty much pay what they want and according to their own payment split and not CNA's split.    The problem here is that the policy itself…the way the billing is shown has to match exactly the way it was laid out to Lockton.  I understand the actual billing installments can't be change, but due to what Mark Pignotti advised that it would not cause an issue, I need the actual installment plan to be revised to match what we gave them originally.  This needs to be done manually.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​RST Rate Change is skewed on all lines for the following reasons. 1) This was originally a 2/1 renewal that was short termed 2/1-4/1 so that we could line up with the WC dates. We are now quoting 4/1-4/1/19 so the rates have not aligned correctly 2) In the last hour today, they bound and asked to bind net of commission. This in itself dropped the rates well over 10% 3) they also bound increasing the GL payroll nearly 40% My rates I believe are severely lower than they should be. I have talked to Mike Ahern, Construction industry leader and he believes that the size curve should be applied more properly.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Can you assist?  I don't think we have enough knowledge on this product to answer the agents question.  -----------------------------------------------------Good morning,We have passed the below on to the insured.  Their attorneys have reviewed and have come back with the following.  Please review this and let me know your stance.Thanks again.Section I.2. of the cyber policy reads:Subject to the Regulatory Expense Limit of Insurance and the Aggregate Limit of Insurance as set forth in the Declarations,we will reimburse you for all reasonable and necessary fees, costs and expenses incurred by you during the policy period, and consented to by us (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), in order to effect compliance with:a.    a security breach notice law;b.    a statute or regulation referenced under the definition of privacy injury and identity theft where the Named Insured has been notified of an actual or alleged breach of such law by a regulatory agency.This limit is part of, and not in addition to, the Aggregate Limit of Insurance.In June 2018, the State of Alabama enacted a new data breach notification law.  I believe this new law meets the definition of security breach notice law as it is defined in the policy.  Navigate needs to hire a professional firm to effect compliance with this new law.  According to the policy, the insurer will reimburse Navigate for these fees and may not unreasonably withhold its consent for Navigate to incur them.Based on the foregoing, it seems to me that the insurer must consent to Navigate incurring these fees and reimburse Navigate for them.  If that is not your understanding (or the insurer's), we need a detailed explanation as to why.  Otherwise, we need a letter or email from the insurer consenting to reimburse the fees.

But when I go into the NCCI website(see below), the 2018 mod was produced and finalized 0n 5/17/18. To my understanding, the emod worksheet is fed automatically to us as soon as it is produced. Please advise.

__label__Package-General-Liability ​Dear Team, Apparently our PMT GL form does not cover Employees who are Temporary workers as defined below.  Is this true and how can we cover this—is there another section in the GL form or endt that brings back the coverage? We have a scenario where our Insured may well be hiring Temp Workers at short notice as outlined by the Insured below. Thanks Adam With respect to the wording for temporary and leased employees as insureds on the GL policy.  From what I see, Employee includes a leased worker, but not a temporary worker: Leased worker means a person leased to you by a labor leasing firm under an agreement between you and the laborleasing firm, to perform duties related to the conduct of your business. Leased worker does not include a temporaryworker. Temporary worker means a person who is furnished to you to substitute for a permanent employee on leave or tomeet seasonal or short-term workload conditions

This Sprint phone never has any service, which makes it quite difficult to use my phone when I'm travelling for work. I can't even get GPS to load on it to get where I need to be. In addition to the lack of service, this phone number receives an average of 5 phone calls a day from random numbers all over the country- automated and real calls. I guess whoever had this number before me applied to every job countrywide he could find and made a lot of inquiries on loans. How can I get these two issues fixed by just getting a new carrier/number?

__label__Package-General-Liability ​  I am not understanding the rate changes on GL.  Exposure is up roughly 11% in terms of square footage but the overall rate and premium are significantly different.  Also When I rate the account I am getting error CAC3171/4746.  I have screen shots of the error if needed. 
__label__Package-Property ​Why is the rate showing -95%. The only change from lsat year is we added a building limit. Ths is also greatly effecting my overall rate. The property is very small in premium size compared to the other lines, why is this rate effecting the overall rate so much? 
__label__Auto The current standard wording used for the attached form is Any Lessor of a covered auto for which we are providing any coverage for that covered auto under this policy.Would you say this would be encompassing of short term and long term leases?

__label__Package-General-Liability ​FRC, We have a discrepancy within RST between when we send an initial renewal quote to agency on this account and when we revised account adding in substantially more gl premium.  Gl code 56652- Machinery parts mfg-                -Initial renewal quote sent out on 9-6-18 (attached) indicated this gl code at loc. 2 (Windsor CT)- with rates of .341 prem and .729 prod.                -this exposure was previously at the Massachusetts location at a $4.00 products rate for magnet mfg….when the exposure was moved to the CT location….rating put the exposure at the CT location at the existing CT rates of .341 and .729 and not the products $4.00 rate we previously had in Mas….agt caught this and advised Ok to increase back up to the $4.00 combined rate.                - the revised quote sent 9-11-18 (attached) increases the prod rate for code 56652 back up to the $4.191 rate it should have been at increasing the prod premium for this code from $4,974 to $28,596. The problem we see with everything that occurred above is that when I released the 9-6-18 quote our gl rate in RST indicated -.9.  Now RST indicated a gl rate indication of – 1.1 total rate decrease?  We are confused as to how adding $24,000 directly into the gl premium via amending the guide A ELP base rate for products code 56652 did not increase the gl rate change substantially? 
__label__Workers-Comp ​Team, Good morning. Please see the attached two endorsements for this WC policy; there was an endorsement amending the experience mod as Final to .880 however, a newer endorsement was processed amending mod to .860—which came with a $62 A/P. Is there anything I'm missing since the mod actually went down, and it generated additional premium. Usually I'll review the rating worksheets however there doesn't seem to be one imaged or uploaded so I can't tell what the changes are per line item. Can you please advise as the broker is inquiring. Thanks,
__label__Package-General-Liability ​Due to a classification change on the GL, I'm not sure that the rate change being calculated by RST is correct. Based on exposure changes, I have manually calculated the GL premium to go from about $13K to about $16K.  It was determined that the expiring policy had not been classified correctly.  Therefore, I added class 16723, Electrical Apparatus - Installation/servicing/or repair with a payroll of $2,239,250. The premium went from about $16K to about $21K due to this change.  I have manually calculated the rate change to be about 31% based on this change. If you are in agreement, would you please manually change the rate achievement in the system?

__label__Auto ​I am very confused by the example on page 29 of the Powerpoint presentation.  I need further clarification, pleaseThe example gives two conflicting statements regarding the vehicles in question.  For the Insured's description of loss:  No damage to other vehicle.  For the Liability portion – Significant damage to vehicle. In the first place, we are not going to get this level of detail on 90% or more of our loss runs making this job even harder.However, I would have defaulted to Collision because the insured rear-ended another vehicle.  I would have looked at this and said, clearly there had to be damage since this resulted in $231,778.01 in liability losses.  Maybe it was only medical type bills, but probably the other vehicle was damaged.So, I ask, why did you default to comprehensive?  Are you saying that just because they ran into something … if the object they hit wasn't damaged, it's comprehensive?  So, if they run into a building and crumple the front of the vehicle and there is no damage to the building, it's comprehensive?   How am I going to know this? IV was parked and it appears someone backed into it.  I would consider this to be comprehensive.  The vehicle was not in motion at the time it was struck and the driver was not in the vehicle.  Same as a tree falling onto the parked car.    IV was at stop sign or red light and OV rear-end them.   I would consider that to be collision.  Actually, I would expect the other individual's liability to cover our insured.  However, if the OV is not insured, our insured could use their uninsured motorists coverage to cover the loss. Employee was driving to job site at 3am.  Got drowsy and ran off road hitting pole.  I would consider this to be collision as well. When loss run is missing sufficient detail to distinguish Liability from Physical Damage, the total loss amount should be coded as collision.

__label__Auto Good Morning, I'm hoping someone can help me gain some clarification in regards to these endts.  Per the first attachment, we issued the Auto policy on an excess basis however the broker advised that the policy should reflect primary. In changing the policy to primary an AP of $55,229 generated at that point the broker asked that the policy be changed back to excess but in doing so the annualized premium changed and no longer matched the agreed upon bound premium of $21,219 In reference to the second attachment, we replaced a location but kept exposures the same and we also added and deleted LP's. Various RP's and AP's generated for these endt's which seem to be incorrect. It was agreed upon that these changes would be made without an AP's.  It would be greatly appreciated if someone can walk me through how I can get this cleared up.

__label__Package-Property ​Good afternoon, The broker on this account reached out to me due to inconsistencies with billing between CNA and Willis. However, when digging into it, I noticed that the Fire Following premium on the policy doesn't match the binder. By rejecting TRIA, the premium would have decreased by $162 ($147+$15).

__label__Workers-Comp ​Would you be able to tell me when the claim reserve was adjusted on claim number E3354129 – claimant Joshua Graham? The adjustment was reported to NCCI causing the EMOD to increase midterm and that resulted in an additional premium. I'm trying to figure out if there was truly a delay in the reporting to NCCI and if this was reported correctly. Is it correct that the change would effect the current term? Per the agent below – was there some delay or explanation we can provide?

__label__Auto ​Can you please advise what the error is related to in RST, please?
__label__Auto ​I have noticed that several of my auto policies that had the hired auto as primary are converting to excess when rolling into EPC.  Since this is a change wouldn't this require a CRN? Can the renewal raters change back to primary rather than us having to have it rerated?
__label__Workers-Comp ​This account is domiciled out of Florida.  There are no other states on the policy at this time in EPC. When we issued the renewal, we noticed that there were multiple named entities showing the same FE # on the application. We issued with only one name and asked for the ERM-14 from the agent.  The agent has come back with an endorsement request indicating that the FEIN 59-2310633 applies to both    Preferred Pools and Patios, Inc. and   Preferred Pools & Spas, Inc.If you look up these entities in the Florida Division of Corporations website (sunbiz.org), you will find that they are both listed as active and both listed under the same FE #.  See attached screen prints. I do not know how you want me to proceed with this situation.  The training we recently attended indicated that this cannot occur but it certainly appears to have happened.  We look forward to your input regarding this situation.

__label__Package-Property ​Hello Team,  can you please review the attached two documents, 'copy' is the issuance rating worksheet and 'copy 2' is the bound quote.  It appears to me that the premium discrepancy is within the 'policy premium' amount or the policy level coverages.  The quote shows those premiums should add up to $303, but the rating worksheets show they add up to $328, a +$25 difference.  Please review and let us know how we should handle.
